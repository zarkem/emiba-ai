Both the baklava & ravani are always impeccably fresh, as are all of Meraki's menu items.  The baklava & ravani are there as you order, so go ahead and order one of each. you won't regret it!  
Meraki has traditional Greek cuts, always tender, robust and basted with lemon, Greek olive oil and various herbs.  They offer classic gyros and are always spot on! 
The Greek spreads such as tzatziki are always consistent and hit the spot!  Who can resist not ordering garlic and cucumbers;)   Perhaps when you first try Meraki May I suggest ordering the combo of spreads.  
The staff exudes enthusiasm and ask away for dining recommendations."

I just recently started the keto diet, so I liked that they had some options available. I had the meraki bowl with no rice, no beans, easy tomatoes and olives on the side (I don't like olives) with their gyro meat. It was delicious! All the flavors mixed very well together and made my taste buds scream of joy. My boyfriend ordered the lamb burger and feta fries. He said it was very tender and rich in flavor. And it was way more than filling. He didn't care too much for the fries, but they were still good nonetheless. He liked dipping them in my tzatziki. 

Overall it was very good food and a great experience. We'll be back when we're on this side of town, most definitely :)"

I passed it by on several occasions because I'm not a huge Greek foodie. Finally, I had to try it. So many great reviews couldn't be wrong. And they weren't. This was by far more than I expected it to be. The menu is massive for such a quaint restaurant. By no means is it a small place, but it feels so warm, friendly and inviting when you walk in. You can make combination upon combination of entrees with this menu! Tried the hummus (Appetizer; $4.49) and it was DELICIOUS! This one was so fresh and flavorful for being so simple. I love hummus and they do it right. Then, my boyfriend and I each got the ""From the Grill"" Gyro plate ($12.95), after the cashier suggested that since it was our first time there. I got mine over rice and my boyfriend had his with the feta fries. The plate is gigantic for one person, so we had to take half of each home to enjoy later. The feta fries are AMAZING and I'm not even a feta fan! The rice was so fluffy and full of flavor, too. The plate comes with a heaping pile of the Gyro meat (beef\/lamb), a nice big salad and side of pita bread. More than enough for one person! The staff is wonderful, friendly, smiley and offers help if you're not sure of what to get. Couldn't have asked for a better dining *first* experience. We will be back time and time again!"

The idea that a place can sustain consistent quality makes me very very glad we found this place. 

We've tried quite a bit of stuff on the menu (as we get something different every time) and most of it is really good.   The dolmadaki is fantastic.   Best I've ever had and it is the one item we get every time.  The spanikopita is pretty delicious as well.    The Greek rice is probably my favorite rice of all that feel places I've ever been to.   So flavorful and delicious.   The only items I've ever tried that I wasn't so hot about were at this last outing.   The agvolemono needs more jazz and the broccoli needs less cooking.   But if that's it then there isn't actually anything to complain about. 

The service is amazing here as well.   You can tell they are a family and like to treat you like you are part of it.   Very friendly, very helpful, very patient.   It also doesn't hurt that I haven't seen one employee who isn't good looking..."

You order from the counter and get a number and they bring you the meal.  The food itself is authentic and great.  As is the waitstaff, and I presume owner\/high management, who was on top of things from the get go, asking how everybody's meal was and acting in a head waiter fashion, moving from table to table.
 
A far as food goes, I had the Meraki gyro with beef\/lamb and was thoroughly full.  Thick pita and tasty meat.  A little too much tzatziki sauce but delicious nonetheless.  I coupled that with a side of hummus which was some of the best in town.  My entire meal came at about $10.  For a great, authentically Greek lunch and extra hummus to take home for an appetizer tonight, I was happy."

The place is beautifully decorated with colors of Blues and greens and crèmes and it reminds you of Greece. You order your food at the front and then sit down. The staff brings your food to the table and picks up the dirty plates. The staff was so nice and friendly and made you feel at home. My group stayed for a while but so did everyone else that came in. People were hanging out and having a good time. I ordered the Meraki gyro which was delicious and the feta fries...Yumm!

The first section is appetizers; Spreads (Greek spreads are so much more than just Hummus and Tzatziki!) and classics like Spanakopita and Dolmadakia (Stuffed Grape Leaves). I like to order the Mezze Plate ($12.79) with Spanakopita, Tzatziki, Hummus, Falafel, Dolmadakia, Marinated Olives, Tomato Salad, and Pita. It's a fantastic way to get a little taste of everything, especially when you can't decide! I would love to try all their spreads next time since I'm a fan of Taramasalata and Melizanosalata (roasted eggplant spread similar to Baba Ganoush, but without tahini); you can get a combination of all five spreads for $21.95.

The second section is basically three dishes:
Meraki Signature Bowl ($9.49)
Classic Greek Salad ($6.49\/$8.79)
Village Greek Salad ($7.49\/$9.49)

The difference between the Classic Greek and the Village Greek salads is the absence of lettuce in the latter, which is more common in Greece. The salads are loaded with tomato, red onion, cucumber, feta cheese, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini, and Greek vinaigrette; plus, grilled pita (I got Tzatziki with mine as well). The signature bowl comes with a choice of Greek Rice or Aegean Quinoa and its elements are the same as the salads with the addition of arugula, marinated garbanzo beans, sliced red radish, and Tzatziki. Very hearty!

There are eleven add-on options with four Vegetarian options. I've tried the Pork Kalamaki ($3.49), Shrimp Kalamaki ($4.49), and Grilled Salmon ($6.95). Kalamaki is a synonym of Souvlaki (used primarily in Southern Greece), but essentially are the grilled meat skewers. Everything I've had is delicious. I really enjoyed the salmon on their Classic Greek Salad as it was light, yet filling. It's a dish I could eat over and over.

The third section has sandwiches (gyros, burgers) and platters\/plates. I've had the Gyro Meraki ($7.95) with beef\/lamb, tomato, lettuce, red onion, Tzatziki, and feta cheese; and the Gyro Plate ($12.95) with Greek Rice or Fries, Greek salad, pita, and Tzatziki. I love gyro meat (the famous beef\/lamb spit) and both are great options; they're essentially the same, so it just depends on my mood. I've had my eye on their Lamb Burger and I'm determined to try it on my next visit.

For desserts, I absolutely love the Baklava Ice Cream ($3.95)! It's Baklava mixed into vanilla ice cream for the perfect treat. Although it's not on the menu, they serve Greek coffee and it is amazing. It's in Espresso format (very small) and I like it sweetened. It transports me back to Greece!

They offer daily specials that are indicated on a 8x10"" display at the registers. I've seen Lavraki (Mediterranean Sea Bass) and steak sandwiches. The most popular special has been their Grilled Octopus ($17.49). It's been served in a couple different ways and it's availability is random, but if it's there when you are, definitely order it. When I had it, there was a Greek-style White Bean Salad that was a nice accompaniment, but the octopus was great on its own. The owner told me that specials are usually offered during dinner since they want to keep service quick during the day, however, I have seen the specials during lunch on weekends.

I am thrilled to have Meraki close to home and I am loving all of it. It does tend to get really busy during lunch, but it moves quickly. The service is amazing, too!"

I had the Meraki Gyro and the French Fries and it was above average.  The price was a bit high, but not out of line.  The decor was inviting and clean.  

The reason for the 2 Star review is mainly due to the ridiculously rude server.  A young woman named Rose I believe.  Here attitude was the worst I have ever encountered in a restaurant.  She was nasty to me when I took out my Amex to pay and said, ""No American Express"".  She was yelling at the cooks in the kitchen.  She must be the daughter of the owner or something, but she is just flat out awful.  The other reason for the 2 Stars is that it took 13 minutes to get my gyro and fries when there was only two other tables in the restaurant at the time.  

There are other Greek places in town that have food just as good, but I can get served much quicker and it is served by smiling faces.

Even if you have no room left (because the portions are big!) save room for the baklava, it's life changing! This place is going to be very successful, it's a good sign when it's packed.

The Mezze plate seemed like a good choice to share between the two of us since it contains an assortment of items. The spreads, which included a smooth and nutty hummus and a creamy tzatziki stood out for us. Everything was well seasoned and flavorful without being overpowering. I've never had dolmades before but these were very good. The spanakopita filling wasn't all that good but the flaky filo was perfect. The falafel was my least favorite item of all since they were too dry and fried too hard, but the flavor was okay. The tomato salad with red onion, Persian cucumbers and feta was great for cleansing the palate and readying our taste buds for desert. For desert we chose to share the rice pudding and the baklava ice cream. GET THE RICE PUDDING!! Best rice pudding I've ever had- perfect texture of chewy yet soft rice with a good amount of cinnamon and sweetness. The baklava ice cream is an interesting concept but wasn't as good as the rice pudding. It contained a huge piece of baklava so that's a plus. Overall this place deserves all five stars. The food tastes homey and fresh, prices are good, and service is great."

The location itself is tucked into a quiet plaza, but the building is quite nice. The decor of the restaurant provides more of a sunny Mediterranean ambiance. 

The Meraki Gyro was delicious. While their chicken was good, I preferred their lamb and beef combination for the Greek sandwiches. In addition their gyro is much larger than any other place you'd find in town considering their pita bread was probably 9 inches in diameter.

Overall I intend to come back to try the other items on their menu, I was just too full after one gyro."

The exterior is nothing fancy, but the interior is very new, bright, and warm. The entire restaurant is spotless.

The format is fast casual, though the presentation and quality of the food is definitely sit-down restaurant level. The workers were all very friendly and happy to answer any questions about the menu. The employee I interacted with the most in particular had a very welcoming smile! =)

I ended up trying one of their specials, which change regularly. It was grilled octopus, and was phenomenal (I LOVE octopus). It was night quite as pretty in the takeout container as plated (I peeked at a neighboring table who had ordered it), but the taste was just the same. I also ordered avgolemono soup, which was great, though I would have liked it every more tart. I also wanted to try the feta fries, which were tasty but probably best hot, they were more lukewarm by the time I ate them at home.

This place is in the middle of a nondescript strip mall right off of Rainbow and Tropicana, but man, they serve up some pretty bomb food.

I got the chicken kebab plate (the kalamakia, I think they call it), and it was served with some salad, pita bread, and fries.  When I asked for fries, the cashier asked, 'regular fries, or feta fries?'  I had no idea what feta fries were, but I love fries, and I love feta, so let's do it!  The GF had some sort of a salad bowl concoction with falafel.

The food came out, and first of all, it's a LOT of food.  I usually eat a lot but even I was laboring through it at the end, but it was so good I had to finish.  I've had chicken kebab that was too dry, too juicy, too flavored, not flavored enough, but this one was just perfect.  And those aforementioned feta fries?  Mmmmmmmmmmmm..... 

My GF couldn't even finish her salad bowl - that thing was humongous too.

Plus the workers there were extremely friendly and polite which really added to the comfortable atmosphere.

Wifey & I came here on a whim after church one weekend because we wanted something not too heavy, but with lots of color.  One Yelp lookup later, and Meraki it was!  I had heard raves about this place before but now I know what all the fuss is about!  Simple, but tasty Greek eats!!

Meraki was lively when we entered - Greek music playing, lots of folks laughing & eating, happy!  Anyone breaking plates, anyone?  I would have joined in!  Really easy menu to view over with appetizers, salads, bowls, gyros, pitas, grill plates, and desserts.  We stuck with something somewhat classic since it was our 1st time:

-Gyro Meraki ($7.95) - Beef\/Lamb (yes stick with this) with tomato, lettuce, red onion, tzatziki, feta

We both got the combo for an extra $2.95 each.  Wifey got her gyro with red onion on the side, Greek Salad (add another $0.95) & a drink.  I got my gyro with EXTRA red onion (oh man how I single-handedly saved Tic-Tacs), Feta Fries (add another $0.79) & a drink.

Do you like feta?  I hope you do because Meraki does too!  They piled the feta on our gyros, and on my fries!  But their feta is very fresh - not overly strong & not dry at all!  So tasty!  Complimented our gyros very well!  And the gyros?  Delicious!  Overflowing with beef\/lamb that was flavorful, tender, and not very lamb-y at all.  And stuffed with lots of fresh veggies!  And the tzatziki?  Damn was it tasty too, my guess is it's made in house!  Tangy, garlicky, creamy - perfect with the rich meat.  Pita was supple & warm, like a pillow for all this Greek goodness.  Absolutely yummy gyros!

The sides were great too - wife's Greek Salad was easily dressed with good quality olive oil, lemon, salt & pepper, feta, and black olives.  So fresh!  Feta Fries were good as well, crunchy fries, with a ton of feta!  To top it all off...they serve Coca-Cola!!  Yessssssss!

Overall it was a delicious lunch!  Freshness was key!  We really enjoyed our meal at Meraki Greek Grill.  We plan on going back soon by looking at the dishes that came out all around us - the Mezze Plate looked like it could feed 4 people!  The whole Rotisserie Chicken platter too!  The Lamb Burger totally looked like a winner!  And you can be sure next time we're gonna get some of the Greek sweets too!"

I'm talking not an empty seat in the house kind of busy, so I figured they probably had forgotten about us. 

Queue lovely employee putting tables together, wiping them down, and placing a Reserved sign right in the center of the table. I walked right over and introduced myself and the table was ours!

The owner was behind the counter taking orders, she first let us know the food would take about 20 minutes and she and I chatted about her history in the restaurant business while she rang me up. She owns this spot with her son *awe* and they have been open 3 months.

I got the Village Greek and added a chicken skewer. Tomato, red onion, cucumber, feta, kalamata olives, pepperocini with a Greek vinaigrette. A few slices of pita bread. The flavors were so fresh and the chicken was tender and packed with flavor. I'd recommend doubling up on the meat with this salad.

Tirokafteri (greek feta & spicy roasted peppers) is now my favorite after tzatkiki (I am an addict). 

They have a ton of classic appetizers to chose from as well. I opt for the Mezze Plate which gives you an array of the appetizers to try if you are wanting to expand your palette. I have yet to try the Greek Toast, but fell in love with the Saganaki last time I ordered.

I always opt for the Gyro (beef\/lamb) Plate because it gives you the most variety of food. Similar to the Gyro sandwich, the Gyro Plate comes with all the ingredients within the Gyro Sandwich, but just unmade (not a wrapped up sandwich). This plate also gives you an option of Greek rice or French fries. In addition to a Greek Salad, Pita and tzatziki side. I always order extra tzatziki and extra pita!

Their Quinoa is also fabulous, and I have heard good things about the Lemon Broccoli (trying this next). 

They do not have Mousakka on the daily menu because it is a traditional dish that takes a lot of effort\/time to prepare correctly. I did hear the owner tell someone they will make it an upcoming special due to the demand\/desire! This excited me immensely. 

For desserts you cannot go wrong at Meraki's! The Baklava is so flaky and cooked to perfection. I could consume two slices myself. The ratio of nut to honey is marvelous. The Ravani was also very good, and the Mama's Rice Pudding was a close second. The Baklava ice cream is also very good, but did not transport the best with all the hot food. 

Overall, YUM YUM YUM. Now I want greek food and its 8:00 a.m. 

Must go!! New Greek favorite in LV.

I have visited three times now. The only complaint I have is that it's so good that you may have to wait a minute or two to claim a parking space and a table during peak times. 

This visit, my husband and I brought his parents. My mother-in-law can be a rather discerning diner. She has, on occasion, completely dismissed a restaurant right at the table if she felt they were lacking in service, taste, cleanliness or atmosphere. I try to steer away from anything other than venues that provide full waiter service to avoid the potential stress. I wasn't worried this time. 

To that point, midway through her meal, she uttered the words ""plato perfecto (perfect plate)"" and proceeded to sing Meraki's praises. Yeah, man, it's THAT good. 

For this visit, we ordered:

- Tirokafteri (feta and roasted red pepper dip with pita bread). Great sharpness and creaminess from the feta cheese, with a nice kick from the red pepper. I had to pace myself with this to avoid being the greedy a-hole that ate all the dip. 

- Small Greek Salad with Salmon. I usually order the small Greek salad with 1-2 add-ons. I added the falafel and gyro on the first visit, salmon and falafel on the second visit, and just salmon this time. While all three items are great, the salmon is exceptional. I was surprised to find such a great and perfectly cooked piece of fish atop a super crisp, super fresh, super delicious salad. Seriously. It's better than salmon I've been served at ""fancier"" establishments.

- Gyro Plate with Rice: My husband ordered this for both of the two visits he's made. He likes everything about it and probably will continue to order this moving forward. He tends to stick to what he likes (probably good for me, yeah?). 

- Meraki Signature Bowl with Rice and Salmon: This was the ""plato perfecto"" that my MIL had for lunch today. It was beautiful. She enjoyed every bite and had about 1\/3 left to take home. 

- Avgolemono: Due to a communication snafu, my FIL had eaten lunch before we arrived to pick them up. He thought we were meeting for dinner. Fortunately, he had room for soup and dessert. Let's just say the soup bowl was totally clean after all was said and done. 

- Ravani (Sweet Semolina Cake): OHMYGOD, where has this been all my life? What a perfectly sweet, but not cloyingly sweet dessert. The cake was most, but not too heavy, and it was accented with a lemony syrup and chopped pistachios. I want more ASAP. 

- Baklava Ice Cream: I have to confess that I am not the biggest fan of baklava. I assume I may not have had ""good"" baklava. That said, I love this ice cream. It eliminates my biggest problem with baklava , which is too much stickiness and a dense chewiness. In its place, you get a nutty creaminess accentuated by bits of flaky filo dough. You can even taste the filo. I suppose I should try Meraki's baklava soon. And the authentic Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts. 

- Sodas: Coca-Cola remix machine, guys! Plus points for not having Pepsi, but plus plus points for being able to have flavored Diet Coke or Diet Sprite. 

The service is also great. Everyone I've encountered has been nothing short of friendly and helpful. As we were leaving, of the staff members even stopped by and asked my MIL how she found everything. 

This honestly may be one of my favorite spots in the city. At the very least, it's my favorite fast casual Greek spot in the city. 

Solid choice all around."

Today I decided to give Meraki a try, after all I've heard and read about it.
The first thing that impressed me was the line to get to the cashier. But the good thing is they are moving fast, and I didn't have to wait forever to put my order in. The lady, who I think is the owner, was super smart and kind.
I had the gyro meraki combo, lamb and beef, with feta fries. It was good, except the meat was a bit too dry in my opinion. 
And the feta fries... I mean, I love feta cheese, I love fries, why the heck didn't I get this idea myself of combining both together?? Haha
The restaurant is super clean, and even if it was packed I could find a spot to seat. One of the lovely ladies from the staff came right away to clean the table (and apologized she didn't do it prior to my seating) and my food came out within 5 minutes.

Located on South Rainbow and West Tropicana. 

The place is clean, small and modern. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table.

I had the Gyro Meraki with Lamb. The meat was cooked to perfection, a well balanced spice level. I loved their pita bread, freshly baked and very fluffy. My bf had their signature bowls where you can customize what you choose. His choice consists of Green Rice, Ahi Tuna, Shrimp Kalamaki, Avocado, Dolmadakia. This bowl came out to be $25, kind of pricey but the food quality was present. The ingredients were crispy and fresh. For dessert, the Mamas rice pudding was sweet and tasty.

Their lamb gyro is so good. The meat is so tender and doesn't taste gamey at all. I would come back here for their gyros and ice cream.

I have been meaning to check Meraki out for awhile since it literally down the road for me. I stopped by for lunch. I ended up getting the Gyro Classico. I was not planning on going combo route but happy they made suggestion. I went with the soup. The soup was great! It different. I was thinking close to creamy chicken and rice soup. It has a hint of citrus flavor but overall nice hearty soup not heavy creamy base soup. Refreshing compliment with Gyro Classico. The Gryro meat was delicious. I could just eat Gyro all day one of my favorite dishes for Greek food. You get nice size portion of Gyro wrapped in nice pita bread. Fill it out with the sauce, tomato, cucumber, and red onion. It perfect balance between flavor, texture, and great dish. I also ordered Hummus start. Amazing. It had great depth of flavor. The consistency was the perfect balance garlic and garbanzo beans. The warm pita bread served on the side dip it in. Another Greek favorite for me could eat all day everyday. So much more to the menu only tapped the surface. I look forward to future visits because the desserts sounds amazing. I just need make sure leave room for desserts.

The interior talk about impressive for small restaurant. You would never guess from the outside. It located right off rainbow in not even strip mall but four or five restaurants all next to one another. It looks more industrial building then made for restaurants. Meraki they do fabulous job of putting their own personality into the restaurant. The minute walk in playing ethic Greek music or assume it is cause I know playing nothing hear on the radio. The photos around the inside display the art and culture of Greek life. The tables and chairs, booths along the sides, and everything new cause before never been restaurant business in that spot. It provides great vibe just chill over great meal. 

The service was five stars all day. I love the fact tell family run business. They care about each and every customer. I look forward to coming back try some of the bowls and again the desserts."

The niko's sandwich was huge and the feta fries was shareable. The village salad didn't come with lettuce but with big slices of tomatoes, cucumbers, and such. I also got a side of shrimp with my salad. The food was good - light & refreshing. The fries were perfectly crisp & the feta wasn't overpowering or anything. 

I'm inclined to come back because the food was good but honestly the prices were a little steep. For the 2 items, it came out to almost $30... and it only came with 4 pieces of shrimp lol. But the portions are pretty big (besides the shrimp lol) so maybe it cancels it out?"

The place has plenty of parking, and there was a good rush of people there for lunch. My friend and I decided on a lot of different items to try. The prices are very reasonable.

Unfortunately my friend forgot to pick up her number or a receipt and all my food came out quickly but hers didn't. She did order before I did.

Poised to celebrate their 6 month anniversary on Tuesday Meraki Greek Grill has been nothing less than an Off-Strip sensation since opening its doors, and on Friday evening after a long work week the decision was made to finally check the place out, a bill of just $64 yielding enough high quality fare to have fed at least one more than a party of three and the offerings almost universally on par with anything else of its kind in Sin City.

Owned by Jerry Goumroian of Henderson's beloved The Great Greek and Nikos Georgousis of Estiatorio Milos fame, the location on South Rainbow in the same plaza that previously housed Elements traditionally considered a tough sell due to its neighborhood, Meraki promises diners a ""quality meal with the best service at an affordable price"" and from the moment one enters the tile and blue space it is fairly obvious that this isn't a run-of-the-mill counter order concept, the women running the front of house moving from register to tableside all clearly quite knowledgeable and extremely pleasant. 

Defined as ""doing something with soul, creativity and love,"" the music light and walls decorated in photographs of Greece plus a mural of Zeus, diners at Meraki are invited to peruse both overhead and paper menus before stepping forward to place an order that is paid for up front, the menu ranging from Appetizers and Desserts to Bowls and Sandwiches all made of great ingredients by a kitchen that works quietly, the staff going so far as to course items out so that, even when busy, no table is overwhelmed.

Told that portions were 'enough but not too big,' a fair assessment at a pricepoint that sees most Appetizers sold for less than $5 for sharable amounts and no more than $15 for main plates that should sate even the most hearty appetite, it was in Family style on boards that three rounds of Food were served in under sixty minutes, course one comprised of smooth Hummus and a mild Eggplant puree plus fried Kefalograviera Cheese that was both stretchy and elegantly saline, two orders of Falafel delivering eight crisp and oilless nuggets lightly perfumed in Onions, Parsley and Garlic.

Not particularly sold on the Pita, a 'good enough' but unremarkable Loaf that is served quartered and warm but not nearly on par with the fluffy housemade pockets at Amena Bakery & Deli, round two saw Nikos and team send out a platter of tender Lamb and Beef served over Fries along with a Lemon-spritzed skewer of Chicken alongside Greek Salad and Tzatziki, the cooling Yogurt not only excellent for creating a makeshift Gyro but also as a dip for Fries, though those looking for something a bit more traditional\/healthy may wish to opt for Rice instead.

Offering Iced Tea and Coke products from a Remix Machine, kids meals also making Juice Boxes or Milk available at an extra charge, dinner concluded by way of 4\/5 of Meraki's Dessert selections, the celebrated Baklava Ice Cream a clever way to serve the classic Honey and Walnut Pastry as a mix-in with scoops of Vanilla though purists may prefer the housemade flaky layers served 'au natural' in two sizable triangles, the Rice Pudding easily one of the best in Las Vegas for staying simple and being served at room temperature while the $3.79 Semolina Cake is nicely soaked at the bottom but still with some tooth at the top and restrained in its sweetness by light notes of Citrus.

****  Budget friendly, fresh, healthy and well-crafted with a staff that excels in making guests of all ages and backgrounds feel welcome Meraki is yet another example of a talented Casino Chef bringing his skills to the neighborhood, a growing trend that is slowly gaining traction and worth supporting as the Las Vegas dining scene evolves into something more than just a place for Celebrity Chefs and tourists visiting the Strip."

I keep getting the Meraki signature bowl because I love the chopped salad and veggies with gyro meat on top. I felt the gyro was sliced paper thin and dried out a bit one time I went. The next time it was cut thicker and better that way. My dining companions usually get the plates and it's a large amount of food. The last visit I had the avgolemono soup which I enjoyed. I tried steak on my salad the last time and it didn't have much flavor but wasn't bad, I just prefer the gyro. I'm going to try the different proteins before I decide on my favorite. Their tzatziki sauce is the best!!! I don't get excited about fries but I love theirs. The baklava ice cream is worth the calories. It seems very family oriented each time I've gone in which is great.

The restaurant is located on the Northwest side of the city in a strip mall.

I came for lunch on a Friday and was surprised by how busy it was. You order your meal at the counter then find a table. Your meal is then brought out to you.

It's very cute inside, with little pots that have live plants on every table. Even though it was crowded, the place was spotless. You order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. Orders take a little while but you soon know why when you see the quality of the food. They also space the orders correctly. If you get an appetizer it doesn't come out all at once with the main and dessert. These are nice touches that many less casual places don't get.

First of all, everything tastes fresh, like they don't cut the tomatoes until you order your burger fresh. We had the lamb burger with feta fries and an eggplant dip appetizer with pita bread. Friends had the gyro with tzatziki and hummus with pita bread. We cross-sampled and all of it was of the same high quality. The food looks like the photos on the review page.

""Awww, I was kinda feeling something else"" whines Midwest poker dude.

""How about that pho place with the soft tendons and killer blood cakes?"" I loudly announce to my Asian car-mates.

""No, no, Greek sounds great!"" his immediate reply.

From the original owners of the Great Greek, comes another blockbuster of a casual Greek eatery.  Fragrant spices and herbs, zesty lemons, peppery olive oil, feta cheese, warm pitas, flavorful lamb and beef. What's not to love? Oh, you order it all at a counter.

Great selection of spreads.  The hummus stands out with its silky smooth texture, earthy sesame, pleasant acidity from fresh lemon and a good dousing of olive oil.  The Melizanosalata (roasted eggplant, think tabolui) equally good.  Zero bitterness or acrid, burnt notes.   Taziki displays perfect sour notes of the yogurt offset by sulfurous, warming garlic and vegetal cucumber.

Tip: all five spreads offered can be sampled on the combination plate.

For ""solid"" food, the spanakopita (layers of crispy phylo surrounding wilted baby spinach and feta cheese) very good.  Little crispy packets of creamy, vegetal goodness. The saganaki (fried block of kefalograviera cheese), also a winner.  Texturally, it's similar to that of fried mozzarella with a hint of sourness. Eat it as soon as you get it.  So good ripping hot and stretched around a fork.

For mains, in general, well flavored Beef and lamb, all cooked well, sliced thin and not dry.  Typical but good gyro fillers.  The lamb burger, oh yeah.  Ground lamb, very well seasoned, covered in a pile of melting feta and topped with Greek salad dressed greens, good eats.

Counter service is very friendly.  The seating area, clean. Portions are large, prices very fair.

I suspect several repeat visits will be made throughout the WSOP.  Looking forward to trying some of their grilled specials and fingers crossed, octopus.

Highly recommended."

The Avgolemono Soup is just perfect!...slightly thick and deliciously lemony with the pita wedges...YUM!!! The Salads are the best you could wish for -- I mean can we bottle the dressing please!

It's the stuff Greek Food dreams are made from! 
My only request is to open an additional location in Green Valley!!

The signature bowl is amazing: huge portion of greek salad, your choice of grain, add on your protein. The grilled shrimp is perfectly seasoned and your carb choice includes quinoa as an option! I challenge you to finish this meal in a single sitting, it isn't possible. Is there such as thing as too much healthy deliciousness? This comes close. Their desserts are divine and you should always grab an order of spanakopita, even if you don't have room for it in your belly, because it reheats just fine. 

But food alone doesn't make a restaurant great. The level of service at this fast-casual spot is ridiculous. They make suggestions as you order, bring you refills despite the self-serve drink station, check on you repeatedly, and make friendly conversation- all this in a clean, modern setting with potted flowers on each table.

We ordered:

Hummus
Melizanosalata--roasted eggplant
Falafel
Pita
Saganaki
Gyro and chicken plate with French fries and Greek salad
Rice pudding
Baklava
Ravani--sweet semolina cake
Baklava ice cream

This was a good amount of food for three people.  It was coursed nicely by very friendly staff.  The pita is pretty standard and somewhat blah.  One of the highlights was the saganaki.  The cheese was very flavorful and it stretched as we picked up pieces to put on our plates.  I wasn't as pleased with the baklava because it was somewhat dry and I like mine served with honey that helps to moisten the flaky pastry.  The semolina cake and the rice pudding are must orders if you're getting dessert.

I don't like when Greek restaurants serve the generic Ricearoni pilaf. The rice is an essential part of the dish and it was disappointing. I also got a chicken kabob and it was okay. Better than the beef but not that great. 

The people weren't that friendly. They weren't rude but they weren't welcoming either. There was plenty of seating available and the restaurant was nice and clean.

The staff is friendly and they get the orders right. And, the place always looks clean and well kept. Only gripes are that it is a very casual place where you order at the counter (although food is served on real plates), and the prices are more reflective of a sit-down restaurant.

Be sure to save room and DO NOT pass up desserts. While Meraki's Semolina Cake drizzled with a lemon syrup and the Baklava are pretty  good, my favorite sweets are the Rice Pudding and the Baklava Ice Cream which are great for sharing(or not! ;)

Pita bread they put it in is warm and delicious.  Sprung for the feta fries for the extra 79 cents and I am ecstatic they took my money and gave me the upgraded fries.   79 cents have never been so well spent.  Super tasty and highly recommend them.  

The place is very nice, clean and the staff is super friendly.  Bathroom was immaculate.  I wouldn't think of going to another Greek place instead of here.  No way!!!    Soft drink selection is extensive from the tap and flavorful the right way.   Sometimes soda just doesn't taste right.  Not an issue here.  

Waiting for the baklava ice cream as we speak.   From what the other reviews say, it's a game changer."

Man, this was so unsuspecting as we rolled up to the strip mall. But you learn to trust Yelpers. And when in Rome, you go where the Yelpers tell you. When in Greece, the same applies. When in Las Vegas, you fire up the app and go where they say. 

It was a business lunch, and while the place was a-hopping and kinda loud, it was so in that friendly, family bustle kind of way. The kind that you want to fill your house with on the weekends, with family coming and going, and good food, and incredible smells. It's all family there, and it's full of those things, including smiles from the service.

For me it was about those Greek fries. Feta fries. Yessir, you pair those with a lamb burger served medium rare and you'll have a real shot and lunchtime glory. It was juicy, soft, and had the subtle taste of tender lamb and not a hint of oldness or game-ness. The fries are the showstoppers with generous amounts of feta and a nice breading to give them body. You will be pressured to share and you will be tempted not to. Follow your heart.

It's a modern space. We had to park a ways away as it was the height of the lunch hour and it was packed, but when we left the parking had cleared out a bit. It's a fast casual concept so you order at the counter, and it's cheaper than full service, but don't expect fast food pricing."

I placed our order and asked that everything be served at the same time, the Mediterranean Grilled Octopus was great as far as seasoning, though the dish had been changed, and instead of being served over a salad was served over cold beans.  Also when my wife asked the blonde server if there was a difference and was told they changed things when they wanted. After the Octopus waited some fifteen minutes for the remainder of the food to arrive and was cold by that time, the salad delivered was not the one I ordered and the Steak Kalamaki platter I ordered with French fries came with rice and the steak kabobs had no seasoning on them at all.

I wish there were some flavored hummus options, but it's all good cause the plain hummus was still excellent!

As we were waiting, we saw the staff deliver 2 gyro plates to a table near by.  I was scared.  They were humongous!  When we received ours, they took up 2\/3 of our entire table.  There was no way I was gonna finish this meal.  I had a good time trying though.   The gyro meat is delicious, tender, and juicy.  The tzatziki sauce was on point.  The Greek salad was light and fresh and tasty.  I got the side of feta fries, which were super good.

Talk about clean eating! Meraki is loaded with greens, fresh veggies and some quality grilled meats. Because of this I ordered their ""Village Salad"" and with a skewer of grilled chicken. A thing a beauty this salad was. The colors, the ingredients, and the flavors, all top-notch.

Let me start with the good and end with the bad....

The food was as everyone's review states... Amazing!!! It was delicious!!! I had the beef and lamb gyro and it was very flavorful without being too heavily spiced. The tzazicki sauce on it was dead on... Hint of acid from the yogurt and lemon just added to the entire bite with the crunchy from the thinly sliced red onions... It was delicious!!! 5\/5

I also upgraded my gyro into a combo by getting a drink and getting the upgraded feta fries. Drink was a drink but it was disappointing that they had no low calorie drinks in the machine... So the only thing that I found to drink was the sparkling water. The feta fries on the other hand was so good!! Perfectly crunchy and perfectly seasoned with the feta cheese just starting to melt into the fries. Totally delish and worth the .79¢ upgrade. 5\/5

I also got the mezze plate (pretty wording for a sampler plate of their appetizers)....Uuuuummmmm yes I was hungry and I wanted to try alot of items so that I would know what to get for the next time.   :D

Everything on there was delicious. The spanakopita was OMG delicious! One of the best I've ever had. The pastry was so freaking flaky...I think I could have inhaled like 20 of them...Lol falafel.... Delicious!!! Perfectly crunchy on the outside and just the right amount of chew on the inside. Dolmadakia was very flavorful as well... And it was served room temperature so the flavor just came rushing out when I bit into it. So good!!! Pretty much everything on there was amazing.  5\/5

Ambiance was very nice. The tables and chairs added a touch of fine dining feeling to the entire place. They definitely were not the cheapo tables and chairs. The place was very open and inviting... The only con to the table set up was that the tables are set up a little too close to each other so that when a large table came in and sat down next to me and my bf, it felt very very crowded... To the point that we had to move to a different booth table on the wall. (4\/5)

So if the food was omg amazing and the ambiance was nice... Why the 3 star review? 

It all comes down to service. When you are a new restaurant in town it's not nice to make your guests feel less then comfortable in your establishment.  The tall skinny guy that took my order was very friendly and he was the only person in that restaurant to touch my table. Mind you there was another older woman walking around delivering food and chatting with the guests. Well she was chatting to all the guests that were white or Greek. Let me explain. I was sitting on the booth side... Right by the entrance was a family of 4 Asians... Then a table of 2 white people then me and my bf... Then another table of 2 white people with a child. The older woman talked with the couple of both sides of me and totally by passed my table. Then she went onto talking to pretty much all the other tables in the dining room except the 2 Asian tables. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive??? But I don't think so. There was another girl taking orders and she pretty much stayed to the middle part of the dining room... BUT if you are new and asking people if the food is good... Shouldn't you ASK everyone?? You can't just look at me and say oh she's Asian so she doesn't know Greek\/middle Eastern food at all. I have worked in a fine dining middle Eastern restaurant in the kitchen so yes I do know my flavors and I do know my food well... Excuse the rant but their attitude rather intentional or not just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. 

Was the food amazing??? Heck yeah it was... Will I return.... Most likely not... The service was just disappointing. Besides the intentional or not racism mentioned above, you can't deliver food without silverware and napkins. No I didn't want a share plate but yes I need napkins when I'm eating and silverware is always necessary when you eat."

Bonus points for being on the West side of town. I LOVE the food, and apparently so does everyone else. Every time I have been in, it's been packed. I would not recommend going during lunch because you will wait a long time. Even though I have an hour, I've had to shovel my food down quickly because it is that busy. It is also pretty small so it's hard to find a table. On our last visit we were able to snag a table, but I felt claustrophobic because the line to order was right next to our table. Next time I will probably order to-go.

I really like the signature bowls here. They are full of flavor and semi-healthy depending on the protein you add. A bowl sets you back $11 and protein is an extra $3-4.

I've been back 3x since. To say the food is ""good"" is an understatement. The food is fantastic! This place is packed at lunch time and for good reason. I have yet to have a meal here I didn't love. 

The service is very friendly. One day when I went in, they had a huge to-go order right before I got there, so they were a bit backed up. But I only ordered soup and pita bread and they got it out to me super fast. Every time I've been, they greet me with a smile. Maybe they're getting used to see me? 

Anyway, it's kind of a quick serve place: go to the counter to order then they bring it out to you. They have Coke Freestyle machine (but sadly, no lime flavored stuff so no diet coke with lime D: ) and fresh brewed tea, as well as a cooler full of beers. 

If you're feeling sick, their soup is the way to go! But their gyros are also extremely tasty. And if you love fries & feta cheese, check out their feta fries. You won't regret it!"

I ordered the Gyro Meraki with beef and lamb and I honestly cannot think of a better way to spend $8. (I guess I'm used to Bay Area prices, but I thought $8 was a STEAL for such a delicious and filling lunch.) The lamb and beef were tender and flavorful, the tomatoes were super fresh, and the tzatziki sauce rounded out this perfect gyro. The portion size is substantial -- I had been starving and still couldn't quite finish my gyro. However, I always have room for dessert, so I ordered rice pudding to share with my boyfriend. Ohhh, the rice pudding was delightful! The server said they had just made it and I could tell -- it was creamy, perfectly sweet, and flavored with cinnamon and vanilla. Heavenly!

This casual restaurant is bright, clean, and efficient. I love how each table is topped with a fresh plant. The staff are super friendly and the food selection is amazing.

As a Gyro aficionado ( I am ), I can't give them 5 Stars. It is Good, but not GR8. The Meat ( Lamb\/Beef ) of course is usually dry. There is something not quite right with the Tzatziki sauce. I can't put my finger ( actually Tongue ) on it. The sauce @ the annual Greek Food Festival ( which I highly recommend btw ) is by far Superior. I have eaten probably a 1,000 + Gyros in my lifetime. No I am not kidding.

The Restaurant is clean, usually packed and the prices are reasonable. The Greek Fries are just OK. I will now try some of their other food items in the near future. Hopefully they are a bit better. There are few places in Vegas that serve Gyros ( sad ). Overall 3.5 Stars from me."

Greek food was on top of everyone's list, so we decided to check out ""Meraki"". With over 300 reviews and a 5* rating and even good large strip restaurant chef's saying the food was good, we had to try it out.
I have to mention that I spent half of the year in Greece, I am a dissent cook and very picky when it comes to Greek food.
So... let's talk about the layout and decor 
It's a cute fast food, ""Grill"" wanna be. 
We ordered 
The Octopus appetizer (Not available, they only have it on the special menu)
Taramosalata (Not available)
Tirokafteri (was too hot not very authentic 3*) 
Saganaki (was good 4.5*)
Pork kalamaki (good 4*)
Beef kalamaki  (a little dry 3*)
Gyro (The spices where all wrong for a Greek gyro, not tasty at all 2*)
Rice (bland 3*)
Feta fries (Arbys fries with feta on it 3*)
Ravani (very good 4*)
Baklava  (too dry, not enough spices, no          butter taste 3*)
Rice pudding  (good 3.5*)
Baklava ice cream  (icy no taste , it felt like they used old baklava sence  it was very hard 2.5*)
Service was fast and friendly  (4*)
We paid $98 + tip for 
4 dinner plates 
3 soft drinks 
4 deserts 
I believe for a fast food place it might be a little high. I pay about the same or a little less in Astoria NY but the taste is more original and their rent is double of LV.
Over all we had a nice dinner.
Now would ""I"" go back?  I don't think so, my ""full blooded Fresh of the boat Greek husband"" will not let me.

The customer service is what quickly locked me in as a guaranteed repeat customer. Small location\/a bit crowded on Sat night, but was immediately welcomed upon entering. I didn't know what to order with a jumble of recommendation combinations on Yelp, so the awesome worker gave me a menu and took his time explaining it and pointing out popular items.

Okok so I got the Jasmine Latte Tea with Boba and Salt Sweet Cream and boyfriend got the Sunrise Sunset Slush. Mine was milky\/flowery\/herbal\/green tea-ish and his was fruity. Both great choices however, I'm sure the Salt Sweet Cream addition would've tasted better on a cold brew, oolong, or black tea rather than an herbal drink.

I guess it's been a while since I visited. I was craving some tea before continuing a road trip. I am so glad I found Brew Tea Bar. The tea was fresh and the customer service was good. The boyfriend and I told them it was our first time and they gave us some recommendations. The worker also checked up on us by first name and asked us if we needed any adjustments. My boyfriend got the Hokkaido milk tea and I got the Jasmine tea latte. Both drinks were strong in tea flavor and had the perfect sweetness. I asked for more sea salt cream to my drink and they did it with no fuss. It really hit the spot. The boyfriend and I stopped in again that weekend.

Since the day I first walked into Brew Tea, I knew I'd get addicted.
The aroma of worth hit me upon entrance, let's break it down:

Setting\/Service:
It's a little ways away from main Vegas spots (i.e. the Strip, Chinatown, Summerlin, Henderson, etc) but it is definitely worth the drive. 
The shop itself is fairly small with minimal seating, but they have a bathroom and that is important. The staff are all super friendly, and they are exceptionally fast at making drinks, even if it's a huge order!
 
Drinks:
HOKKAIDO MILK TEA W\/ SEA SALT CREAM & HONEY BOBA,
I think my friend told me it's about 1000 calories, but is it worth it? HELL YEAH.
Warm perfectly-textured boba, with the perfect amount of sweetness and flavor, that every time I get the chance to come here, I'm double(sometimes triple)-fisting out the door. 

*hint* get a stamp card and start your addiction to delicious boba!

Overall: A+
I don't think I can get boba anywhere else in Vegas, Kung Fu used to be the go-to but Brew Tea has taken the crown, so now whenever I'm in vegas, I'll be there. Thanks Brew Tea!"

I'm so glad I did. First off, I'd like to commend the staff for being so incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about all the drinks on the menu. Because it was my first time there, I was recommended the Hokkaido milk tea since I prefer something creamy over tea-tasting. I added the boba and the drink altogether was just the right amount of sweet and creamy. Really like the honey taste to the boba!

I also ordered the cold brew with the sea salt cream, an off-menu choice that was recommended when I asked about the cream itself (it sounded pretty good--I'm really into combining salty and sweet). Another great choice! Iced coffee is my go-to when I want to wake up a little, and I really like that hint of saltiness in the cream. I recommend this to anyone who's up for mixing up their regular iced coffee preferences.

Lastly, I got the caramela crepe with whipped cream since I was getting hungry. It looked pretty and tasted great, too. :)

I should definitely start saving some gas money to make more trips here. Now I totally understand why people keep coming back and why everyone keeps telling me to go. Cheers!"

But they make your drinks pretty quick! A drink that I love from this place is the Okinawa with boba, I always come to Brew Tea just for that specific drink. I have also tried their crepes, which is good as well. This spot is popular for friends hanging out and for people to study. 

Once you enter the store the cashier will be to your left and depending on the day they may or may not have a rush. Once you place your order and pay you wait to the left side where they will bring out your drink. If you chose to sit on a table they will run it out directly to you, which I appreciate! Each time they gave me my drink they'd always say ""let us know if something is wrong and we'll make arrangements on your drink."" It's rare to find a business that cares for their customers and does not hesitate to make things right. At other boba places that I have been to when they get our order wrong they question you or tell you ""yes you did order that drink [that way],"" and you're left with feeling as if you have no option but to take what is given to you... Fortunately, not at Brew Tea, YAY! 

The only thing I don't like about this place is the lack of tables and space during their busy hours. Price ranges depending on what you want, two large drinks with boba costs me about $11. Also, they have stamp cards just ask for it."

They're always fully staffed, who's  quick to make whatever you order. They kinda look like their dancing behind the counter with how perfectly they work around each other!

I'm originally from socal and I've missed socal boba ever since I moved to Vegas years ago. I've tried various boba spots big and small but never quite found what I was looking for. That is, until I heard about a little heaven on earth called brew tea bar.
From their spot on mango green tea to their impeccable friendly service to the soft warm and chewy boba we all know and love, everything is always wonderful!
Everyone tells me I'm addicted lol but how can I not go more than twice a week? Their boba just makes me happy, productive, and honestly, sometimes I think I work better after an ice cold mango green tea. I guess that would be considered addiction, but it's just so good!

Service 3\/5
We came in with our dog and the girl the counter asked us if it was a service dog, we said yes. Then she asked us if she could see some paperwork (which lawfully she is not allowed to do) and if we couldn't provide it we'd have to sit outside. She mentioned to see paperwork again, luckily the one table that was outside just freed up so we sat outside to avoid her having to keep asking. 
However, the drinks came out fast especially considering how busy they were. They also added sweetener to one of our drinks after I asked because it wasn't sweet enough. 

Drinks 3\/5
We ordered a jasmine tea and their popular Hokkaido, both with boba. Took the first sip of my Hokkaido and all I can say is that it was kind of basic. Tasted like any standard boba milk tea you'd find at tea station, volcano, half & half, etc. The boba was soft and chewy which was good but tea wise it wasn't anything special. Also can't say I liked jasmine because no matter where I get it it tastes like I'm drinking lotion. But my friend who did get it was not impressed. 

Overall our experience was underwhelming. Maybe we ordered the wrong drinks? If I'm on this side of town I might ty it again, but can't say I'll go out of my way to grab boba from here when there's a great karate inspired boba place near my house that also welcomes our dog ;)"

The cashier, as I was ordering, stressed that they are satisfaction guaranteed, and if we don't like our drinks they will make a different one or adjust sweetness level, etc. That is a smart business move, as it makes the guest feel important. That the company cares. When I picked up my drink, the barista said again to let him know if there was any problem. NOPE!! I had a Caramel Milk Tea (absolutely delicious) and my friend got a Thai Tea with boba. I tried his, although I don't like boba, it was also delicious.

Usually these type of drinks come with the sealed lids to mix it up the foam and coffee easier before you put your straw in (shake it up)!

It's still the same amazing experience and wonderful drinks since my original review!

For the first year and most of the second, I was obsessed with their Smokey Oolong and High Mountain (Green Oolong) Tea Lattes with their signature Sea Salt Crème. Still very good drinks, but for the last few months, I've had the appetite for something lighter. After trying a few drinks, I have my new go-to beverage: Iced Mango Passion Fruit Green Tea with Boba (Less Sweet). It is refreshing, fruity, and so satisfying. This is absolutely my favorite dessert!

Ruben's favorites are Sunset on the Beach Slush and Cold Brew with Sea Salt Crème (Cafe Latte) and though not my type of drinks, they are so good and I love sneaking a couple (or a few) sips.

Their crepes are also really good. I love the Caramela ($4.95) with fresh banana, caramel sauce, and slivered almonds, plus a scoop of vanilla ice cream (+$1). So delicious, you almost don't want to share it. The bad thing is that I can't indulge in a crepe and a boba tea together as it's much too sweet. It's a tough decision as they're both so desirable (but, of course, boba wins 99% of the time).

They still have their rewards program, but they've traded the stamp cards for electronic stars! The program is registered under your name and phone number and you receive a text message when you achieve a reward. Ten drinks equal a FREE Regular drink (upgrade to Large for $1).

It can get reeeally busy and pretty crowded (especially after school), but service is extremely quick (and very friendly)!

The rose flavor was good and not too sweet as I am aware that other places use a very sweet syrup extract for their rose milk tea.

Everything was of course, delicious. This place has the best Taro (slush and milk tea) in the Vegas valley. The brewmasters are able to adjust sweetness and the amount of boba you want in your drink. 
What really got me was the customer service. I walked in with a napping toddler in PJs and a grumpy preschooler. They bagged my large drink order and helped me to my car, during an incredibly busy time. After they helped, they told me ""next time just call ahead it'll be easier for you"". And so I did, they took my order over the phone. I showed up, kids in tow, walked right up to the counter, paid and left all under 30 seconds.

Brew Tea Bar definitely didn't disappoint! The staff, drinks and atmosphere are all quite phenomenal, leaving us to be completely loyal to them and unable to go to any other boba place.

If you're looking for variety, they have it! And once before, we simply asked if they could make a drink that wasn't on the menu and they came through!
It is great knowing that they will remake your drink or make you a completely different one if you didn't favor it.
They ask if you'd like the regular sweetness of your specific drink which is very rare at other places.

Their signature honey boba is fresh, soft, and slightly sweet. I'd recommend it in pretty much any milk tea. My absolute favorite drink here is the iced taro milk tea, which they make with REAL taro. If you ask they'll even let you try a spoonful of the taro they make it with. (If you really like taro you can order it as your topping instead of boba too) It's fantastic! I've never cared for taro milk teas anywhere else but this one is something else. When its cold outside, I recommend a hot Brew milk tea with boba or one of their Latte Teas which have sea salt creme. I mostly order milk teas, so I'll also recommend the Okinawa (brown sugar), Matcha (green tea), or the Brew milk tea. 

The milk teas at Brew have a stronger tea flavor than their competitors and that's what I like about this place. Kung Fu (a different boba place) is comparable but their drinks are creamier and not as strong as Brew. I definitely go out of my way for Brew sometimes, but for that taro milk tea I'd say its worth it.

They have great people here. Even when the line is long, you're always greeted by friendly faces and they make the drinks quick and fresh. The atmosphere here is really vibrant and high energy, but I wish the interior was roomier. There's only three or four tables where people can sit and then a bench where you can wait for your order. Not too big of a deal because most people just get their boba and go. There's also tons of parking available, which makes boba runs here less stressful than the places in Chinatown. Don't forget to get a stamp card! You'll get a free drink every 10 drinks\/stamps."

At most other places I get Wintermelon Green Tea or Passion Fruit, but every time I come here I go for their milk teas.

My personal favorite is the Okinawan Milk Tea. It has like a brown-sugar taste to it and has more flavor (to me) than my second favorite there, which is the Hokkaido Milk Tea that has a more caramel taste. Can't forget the tapioca...their tapioca is alway the right amount of soft and chewy and makes the drink even more enjoyable.

If you go earlier in the day it's usually not too crowded, but usually from like 3pm-until closing, I've never seen it not slow. Despite how busy they get, they still manage to get the drinks made very quickly and I never have to wait more than like 2 minutes.

I have been to many other bubble tea places in Vegas and this place is still my favorite spot. The drinks are ALWAYS consistent no matter who's working. I never had a single drink that I didn't like or had to make any adjustments to my drinks. 

I have waaay too many favorites here but my new favorite and go-to is their iced Yerba Mate tea w\/ sea salt cream half sweet (thank you Mara :)). I'm not sure how to describe their mate but it has a distinct and earthy taste. Another tea recommendation I have is their Oolong tea (the black\/smokey one over the green tea one). If you want something sweet , you can never go wrong with their classic Brew milk tea , Hokkaido or Okinawa. Their mate is quite caffeinated but their cold brew w\/ sea salt cream is very very good if you want coffee. It's similar to Vietnamese iced coffee but not as sweet. I absolutely love their cold brew because it doesn't give insulin dump like coffee you get from other places.

They have the highest quality tea that is made upon ordering (none of that powdered stuff). When a place has over 800 reviews and still maintains a 5 star rating that's really impressive. I can't wait for their new menu to come out too. I'm always willing to drive the 20-30 minutes just for their drinks here :9 Brew is the best."

I saw lavender on the menu and I inquired if they make Lavender Latte.  They can!  With their sea salt cream apparently - only found at Brew Tea Bar.  Was specified as ""our sea salt cream"" several times.  Sounds super official.  Except made with whole milk.  No, says my tummy.  Bummed just a pinch, cuz I was loving the sound of that.

I was still able to have the Lavender with almond milk.  It's only available hot or iced.  Blended sounds more summery though, right?  It's okay!  Got it with Level 4 sweetness.  Very awesome!  Nice gesture - the tall young lady even asked me, using my first name, how I liked it.  I LOVED IT!  

Please forgive me for not acknowledging the tall lady's name.  She should know who she is.  Very helpful and sort of educating me on how their tea orders are prepared.  Superb customer service on her part.  She even informed me of the wait for brewing time.

Crepes on the menu!  See... this is how to retain customers by offering variety and a reason to stay.  They have so much traffic in here that I had to tell them they need more space!  Guess what tea butt?  They're opening another location.  You probably knew that.  But heyyyyy..."

But fortunately, we left pretty happy with our drinks. 

To first start about our experience the service, we received exceptional service from who I can only assume is the owner or manager of the place. He was very friendly to us, making small talk and emphasizing that we can keep coming back to ask for adjustments to our drinks until we're completely satisfied. I hear this from many people at other boba shops, but there is a different kind of vibe you get from him where you can tell he truly cares about you having a good experience there. He even came up to us after we tasted our drinks to make sure the sweetness level was fine, since it was something we were unsure about when we chose it to be less sweet.

As for the drinks themselves, we got the brew milk tea and the jasmine milk tea. Both drinks were done very well! We got 75% sweetness, which my friend thought was good, but I think I'll go for 50% next time because I thought it was a little too sweet. We can't say anything about the boba, though, since we didn't try it.

Overall, it was a great experience. It was significantly better than several places we've tried in Southern California, so kudos for satisfying our milk tea cravings while we were away from home. We recommend anyone in the area who need their milk tea fixes to come here."

I like the atmosphere. It's small with a few tables and some seating near the window.

As soon as I walked in, I was immediately greeted and the guy at the cashier asked if it was my first time there. I was offered an explanation of the different teas. Then a girl came over & he tells her to give me some samples. 

Upon trying the bobas, I asked what is popular and she suggested Jasmine Latte with Sea salt creme. I addded boba to it. She says they use honey instead of sugar.

It took only about 2-3 minutes for my tea. It was unique, earthy but was perfect, not too sweet and definitely not bland.

The boba was little chewy, fresh, and slightly sweet.

Now for my recommendations... I have two #1's depending on my mood: If I want a tea, I get my regular mango green tea with extra ice -- what makes me happy is when I ask for extra ice, they put it in a bigger cup so I don't get jipped by all the space the ice takes up.

Their drinks range from slushies, latte teas,  iced teas, milk teas, and fresh brew.

They gave a generous amount of ice (not too little\/not too much) and their drinks were AMAZING! We had also gotten their classic crepe which contained nutella, bananas, and strawberries. It was delicious and I would definitely recommend! :) Quality drinks and food so you won't be disappointed coming here; no wonder why they're straight up 5-stars!

Now I want to give a shout out to one of their workers there because she was the sweetest person ever!

Brew Tea Bar has cemented itself as the premier boba spot in Las Vegas. Every local knows of this spot and the simple design of it's cups is recognizable anywhere around the valley. There's even people who come from other states who make the journey to try the teas and boba here. I remember growing up in Vegas Boba wasn't really as popular as it is now. The go to spot was Volcano tea and they had the very basics. Being Taiwanese I've been to Taiwan many times and Taiwan is of course the birthplace of Boba. It doesn't get any better than Taiwan. I used to come back wishing there was something that could match the incredible flavors found in the far east yet volcano was the only and best option at the time and I had given up on any hope of finding something better. Fast forward a few years and it's my first visit to brew tea which was a couple weeks after opening. I was greeted by a helpful  employee who broke down the menu and popular items. I proceeded to get Hokkaido milk tea cause it sounded cool and with my first sip I discovered a flavor that seemed to be lost to me since childhood. I finished my drink and proceeded to come back 4\/7 days that week. 

Service: Top Notch. 100%. The owners are always there in the trenches working alongside the workers and every employee there is personable and friendly. They take their time and give every guest the attention they need while also being able manage packed crowds and busting out drinks in record time. I never have to worry about a long wait even if the line is out the door as their efficiency is proven and I'll know i'll get my order in no time. They always invite you to ask for adjustments if necessary and they do it with no questions asked. There's also a reward system where if you get 10 drinks the next regular sized one is free which is great as it's always good to reward frequent customers. And personally I've abused this perk many times over. This place didn't become the go to spot in Vegas off of it's product alone but coupled along with it's excellent service brew leaves just as much a lasting impression as its teas. 

Teas: Everything here is good. You literally can not go wrong as long as it's something you'd normally partake in or enjoy. Even stepping out of your comfort zone at times leads to pleasant  surprises. The tea is fresh and the ratio from sweetness to ice is all customizable so you can get the perfect flavor profile. I can't stress enough how refreshing these teas are. The boba is also made fresh everyday and contrary to popular belief boba making is an art and to get that perfect texture of softness and chewiness couple with the right temperature with the teas is work of art and brew masters it. And of course the sea salt cream is absolutely addicting and can make an regular drink that much more enjoyable. It's a savory treat as you taste it little but little as it mixes with your tea and at the end it's just all there to be engulfed. The ultimate guilty pleasure. 

Crepes: The crepes here are all handmade as well and although it doesn't follow any traditional techniques they are still delicious and it's a perfect accompaniment to your drinks especially if you're hanging out with a group of friends. Personally I love the aroma that surrounds this place when the crepes are being made as it's definitely a inviting yet delicious scent. 

This is the closest thing to Boba found overseas and everything about this place is top notch. I come here at lease once a week if not more and I've spent many hours here sitting with friends and hanging out. They've been open for awhile now and yet the quality has never gone down in the slightest sense. If you ever wondered what the best boba place in Vegas is this is the place. Hands down.

Needless to say, I have high standards for good boba and Brew Tea Bar is dare I say, better? Looking at other 626 Yelpers - you're right, the place spacious enough for waiting; but is not designed for hanging out, studying, playing cards, etc. which nearly all the 626 boba places cater to. However, this is not a problem for me though as I usually take my boba to go.

BUT BACK TO THE TEA. We got a Black Tea Latte and Jasmine latte, both with boba. The tea tastes fresh and not powdery.

They didn't make me feel dumb asking about their drinks because it was my first time here. Will definitely be back and extremely glad to have high quality, yet affordable tea.

* The taste of the flavors: Awesome! (Hokkaido is my fav)

* The prices: Awesome!

* Their willingness to let customers create their own drink combining different flavors: Awesome!

The only con would be that since they get so busy, you sometimes have to get your drink to-go since there may not be anymore tables & chairs. I hope they can expand =)

Other than that, taking it to-go is no prpblem!

The drinks are so good, there can often be times where the line is out the door!

Best Customer Service!

What I've tried: 
I'm a creature of habit so I rotate between the Taro, Okinawa and Strawberry Milk Tea.
My friends, who are also regulars, get drinks with Sea Salt Cream or Taro topped off their drink and they almost always comment on how the toppings always compliment the drink. So try to get those toppers as an added bonus if the drink suits it!

Some things to keep in mind:
**The texture of the boba is usually soft and very chewy.
**You can customize the drinks to your preference (Sweetness Level, Amount of Boba, etc). If you don't like what they served you, you can Always ask them to readjust it.
**The place has very limited seating
**They have Digital Stamp Cards: 10 drinks = 1 Free Drink (You still have to pay for the toppings), you will need to give them a phone number to log your stamps in their system.
**You can customize the drinks to your preference (Sweetness Level, Amount of Boba, etc). If you don't like what they served you, you can Always ask them to redo it.
**If you know your order in advance, Call Them! Staff can time the drinks to be made as you get there (and possibly see a long line)."

Drinks: their specialty is Fresh Brewed Tea. However, they also have smoothies and coffee too. Their smoothies are not from fresh fruit so do 't expect healthy fruit drinks.

It's a win when you walk in and there's not some sort of line. I started coming here for the Cold Brew coffee, literally the best when I need a pick me up. Make sure you mix the coffee (you kind of just twirl it in a circular motion since they don't have the typical sealed top) I recently have been getting the taro slush, it has real taro on top. I like to mix it in and you get taro chunks. If you don't want an overwhelmingly amount of sweet, I recommend to get it half sweetened, trust me it's still a good amount of sweet. If you're feeling like you need a little extra definitely share a classic crepe with ice cream. 

The drinks on the board isn't their only option. They have another menu that has twice the drinks. So, if nothing looks appealing to you, definitely ask for that one. 

They recently switched their reward system to one on their POS. But good news folks, if you still have your paper stamp cards, it can be transferred! The one downside is that you don't get a star if you buy food, just drinks.

The sweet, succulent tea, in conjunction with the savory boba, swirls together in your mouth perfectly, leaving behind an explosion of flavor from the first sip, to the last, and then some after. 

I was delighted to have found this place out. The way they hand-brew their tea is akin to listening to a symphony by Mozart, or watching van Gogh paint Starry Night.

They use fresh Taro to make their Taro drinks and I got a few tastes of that.  It was pretty good, but taro isn't really my thing.  For people that like Taro, I recommend you try one of their taro drinks.

They have a few tables where you can have your drink and your crepe if you order one.  They also have a bathroom and drinking water.

The dude that helped us really went out of his way to make sure we liked our drinks and that he could make something else if we didn't.  They all had names on the back of their shirt, but I forgot what his name was.  We talked to at least 3 different staff members throughout the visit and they were all helpful and nice.

Anyone that rates this below 4 stars is trippin.  The product is great and so is the staff, if you had a below 4 star experience, you should go back and give them another try."

i have never been to an establishment that cares so much that you like what you order.

they'll customize your drink to your exact specifications and they'll do it over and over until they get it just right.
they're knowledgeable in the product they offer and make smart recommendations based on what you like.
they take the time to make sure you're happy, despite the line out the door, but then again that's probably why they have a line out the door.

Why is it the Northeast can't seem to make good boba tea like they do out here in the West coast? I tried my go to boba drink during my visit-- taro slushie with honey boba. The little bit of taro deliciousness they put in the drink just puts it over the top! True taro taste, great soft and chewy boba... like I said, I need to take one of these drinks back to the Northeast and show them what real boba is like.  

My sister asked the guy at the counter for a recommendation and he advised her to get the Okinawa, which wasn't anywhere on the menu. She ended up getting the Hokaida milk tea for our brother and testing out the Okinawa with salted cream. Of course I had to sneak sips... the Hokaida was mellow, but we both fell in love with the Okinawa. It tasted a lot like taho, you know, that Filipino hot silken tofu dessert doused with brown sugar or honey syrup hawked by street vendors back in the homeland.  This was the drink I had to have on my second visit the next day.

This place gets 5 stars for its awesome drinks. It's those little details--the scoop of taro, that indulgent sea salt cream-- that really makes this place stand out among other tea places. I think they need a bit more room inside as it seems to get quite crowded, but really it doesn't detract from the drinks as most people grab and go anyway. Also, great work with going techy with the iPad system. I thought it was genius they did away with the paper punch cards and went digital.

They're really efficient here, but still not trying to hurry you out the door. Everyone is really informative and they even offer to adjust your drink if you have issues with it.

I ordered the Hokkaido milk tea with sea salt cream and boba. I got it 50% sweetness since I read another Yelp review that said the drink is like 1000 calories and I got scared. I'm also not a fan of super sweet drinks. They told me that the sea salt cream is supposed to make it less sweet as well, but it still ended up being too sweet for me. I'll go 25% next time and recommend anyone that's not too huge a fan of sweetness to do the same.

Their boba is sooooooooooo soft, probably one of the best textures and consistencies I've ever had. But some people may actually like it chewier. If you let the boba sit for a bit before drinking, it'll harden a bit.

This place is definitely comparable to the better ones in the 626 (San Gabriel Valley near LA, land of the bobaz), so it's nice to know that this is always an option when I go to Vegas!"

The customer service is excellent- the staff is always willing to answer questions and give recommendations, and will remake anything if it's not to your liking (though I have never had to take advantage of that since the drinks are consistent). 

I wish it was open earlier so I could grab a tea on the way to work, but my bank account is probably better off with the occasional afternoon tea. They do get pretty busy when the nearby schools let out but they keep the line moving.

He got the taro milk tea, and I got the large mango latte with half sweetness. That was a good decision, since the drink was already sweet. The sea cream enhanced the flavors of the drink. We both enjoyed our drinks immensely. Service was friendly and quick.

Probably the best of Vegas. Came here for drinks and dessert after lunch with family. I ordered their HokiOki, which is half Hokkaido and half Okinawa milk tea mixed together, less sweetened.

I have never had anything like it, and will try to order something like it here in California to see if it's just as good. 

GOODS:
-great atmosphere: place is nicely decorated and gives off good vibes; great place for groups\/catch ups
-quality: their drinks and desserts are GREAT quality; the drinks aren't watered down, and are well made; you can choose your level of sweetness, so you can have your drink the way you like it
-friendly staff: ready to answer your questions, and are all so happy to serve you 


NOT-SO-GOODS:
-no wifi

I came here to do some quick work on my laptop and to say I was pleasantly surprised would be serving this place no justice. Looking at a menu as variety heavy as they have of tea options can be as overwhelming as a foreign language could be. But then, the cashier (Catrina, I believe) asked if I needed help. Trying to be an adult, I said no. Totally disregarding my declination for help, she forced some suggestions on me anyway. And, of course, they helped. 

I ended up grabbing a ""PB crepe"" which disappointed me at first because it's topped with literally 3 slices of strawberries & 3 slices of banana only... but then I cut into it and it was STACKED with them. And peanut butter. And ice cream (worth the upcharge). I've never seen one so fat before. 

I ate it outside because this place was popping like a madhouse and the only table outside was the only one that opened up and I pounced on it. I ordered it to go when I saw there was no table, but they saw I found one and made the order for here just to be thoughtful. They have mini cups of water that I didn't see at first until I inquired, but they insisted on giving me a large water anyway. They are like the mom that you tell you want only one scoop of food and they throw two scoops on your plate. That's a mom that loves you. 

I went out of my way to comment to the manager directly how pleased I was with my experience, it was THAT good. In the words of the Terminator, ""I'll be back."

As expected, the parlor was quite crowded with plenty of patrons sitting at the tables and hanging out with friends. Their selection of teas is cutely written on chalkboard menus, divided into fruit teas, lattes, milk teas, and smoothies. Behind the counter, there was an army of people making drinks, working in an efficient assembly line that had orders being completed at a rapid fire rate.

I really wanted to purchase every single flavor there, but deciding to rein in my over-excited sweet tooth, I chose the ""Brew Bar"" milk tea with egg pudding in the large size at normal sweetness with light ice. I took that first sip and instantly understood why Brew Tea Bar is so popular.

SO FREAKIN' GOOD! The tea was nicely roasted with a slight bitter undertone that was quickly blanketed by the sweetness of the creamy milk. The one thing that really impressed me though was the egg pudding. It had a delicious custard taste and a slight sweetness as well. Normally egg pudding just adds texture, but not the one here. It was absolutely addictive!

Due to the heat, I finished my boba cup a lot faster than I would have liked, but I loved every single sip of it. If only my vacation had lasted longer, then I would have come back again and again.

Simply put, I think that all boba places in Vegas strive to reach Brew Tea Bar status in their own way, but there can only be one that serves as the baseline comparison.

One that has obviously set the standard of dedication to providing excellent customer service and delivering quality drinks -- consistently. They've perfected their craft, and I'm glad that their second location will be opening in Henderson. 

Read any of the other reviews for the deets. My only gripe is that their small size looks smaller than most and of course there might be a wait during peak hours because yeah, they're the popular kid in town."

When I got there the line was long (led to outside of the store), but no worries! Their service was efficient and friendly throughout the crazy rush, kudos to their composure! I only had to wait for around 10 minutes at most.

I ordered the Mango Latte Tea and I'll just say that it is my new favorite boba drink out of everything else! The sea salt creme is what makes it 300x amazing for me. The combo of that and the tea make the perfect balance of salty and sweet for the drink.

Even if this was really close to me I think I would avoid it as my ""main"" tea place just because of the crowd. I don't disagree that it may be the best tea house in Vegas but I think the degree of separation between the best tea and the second best is so small that it would be unnoticeable to the casual tea drinker.

.......HANDS DOWN!

Brew Tea is the type of business that knows what it does well, and does that as well as possible. 

Who: The staff here are very friendly and efficient, and will happily remake your drink if you it was made wrong, or if you're not a fan.

What: They serve boba drinks in various ways (Tea, Coffee, Slush, and Milk Tea.)

Where: Southwest side of town off of Rainbow and Warm Springs (In the same plaza as Albertsons)

I've yet to have a drink here that I didn't enjoy. 

Some of my favorites include: Coffee Latte, Taro Slush, Hokkaido Milk Tea, Rose Milk Tea, & Strawberry Milk Tea.


Price is reasonable.

10\/10.

TIP: They have various sweetness levels, so keep it in mind. I tend to favor ""half-sweet"" (50%) or less sweet (75%) over having it regular.

Also, get a stamp card! Once you go here, going here 10 times won't seem difficult at all."

The best Boba in Vegas not to mention incredible service. We went in as newbies and the team behind the counter spent time helping me with my decision. We ended up ordering two crepes (delish!), an Okinawa milk tea with sea salt and boba and a jasmine milk tea with sea salt and boba (the last drink my drink). They warned me that r would be extra creamy and that it was... still delicious, but just very very creamy. It must have been the owner that noticed, but I probably had a look of discontent on my face. Not to mention I was gulping down my husbands drink. Completely out of the blue, the owner or manager came up to me with a new drink. A jasmine latte with boba and said that's how the drink should be if you add sea salt. The tea was so flavorful and delicious! It's really that small gesture that earned this place five stars. Well let's be real... I would have given them five stars because the drinks are incredible and the crepes are delicious, but I am such a fan of places that really take care of their customers.

My latest obsession has been with rose green milk tea, so I was pretty excited to see that on the menu. Ordered that half sugar, and I was a little confused at first.

I also had a sip of my friend's almond green milk tea, and I have to say that was a lot better than my drink.

When it finally came to our turn to order, the cashier was extremely friendly, asking if we've been here before and explaining the menu to us. Some places do this, but she definitely went above and beyond with her customer service. I usually get no sugar added in my drink since I don't like it tasting too sweet. She made sure that my drink tasted okay, though it was more than okay, it was amazing! I could really taste the tea taste in the drink which I really enjoyed. It was probably better than most boba places even in Houston. My friends and I also shared a classic crepe which consisted of strawberry, banana, and nutella. We added ice cream to it, thinking it would be on top, but when it came out, the ice cream was actually inside the crepe. This was different than what I was used to but I actually liked the idea.

I was introduced to BYB by my love and instantly became a huge fan. I only order Taro Milk Tea with boba, an extra scoop of fresh taro, and less sweet. You want to mix it well with the thick straw since the real Taro sinks to the bottom. I love boba in my drinks, and BTB's boba is simply the best around--always fresh and fun to chew. Brew Tea is perfect as a dessert, or it can even be used to kill your hunger.

As Phillip T reviewed, this place runs like a boy bands well harmonized song...it doesn't matter how long the line might be, the staff are composed and ready to welcome you with their gleaming white toothed smiles. I have never had any unsatisfactory boba, but in case you do, they will remake your drink until you are satisfied...isn't that wonderful and doesn't it give you a little peace of mind?

They offer a stamp card to appreciate loyal customers like myself...after 10 stamps, you will get one free. 

So do you love milk tea? Then come get yours at Brew Tea Bar...and I'll see you there!

She claimed it as her favorite boba shop, so we knew it was a must to stop by.

Upon walking in, I could see an array of drinks on the wall. My friend told me that they were known for their sea salt drinks and all the Latte choices were sea salt based. I felt very fruity, so I ordered the Strawberry Latte with regular sweetness.

Our drinks were speedy, so there was no waiting for them a long time. My drink had great flavor from the strawberry, and it did not have an artificial taste like most strawberry milk teas have, and the sea salt cream on top gave a nice salty, creamy texture. I really really really loved this drink. Not kidding. So goood. I chugged this thing like there was no tomorrow and the world was ending.

I would come here again 100% and try their other drink for sure. It was that good ladies and gents. A+!"

But I have to give them 5 star for my experience. The customer service was good. They explained and answered our questions. I got the Hokkaido milk tea and taro smoothie. The milk tea was smooth and creamy with a distinctive taste. The taro I believe is made from flavor powder but don't take my word for it. The scoop on top is for sure real taro and that was really good.

I have never received a bad drink or crepe from Brew, but the employees always ask how our drinks are and if we need any adjustments.  They care about quality control and service!  Which is probably why the line is usually out the door whenever my husband and I come here.  

This is our favorite place to take out of town guests when they want to get their boba fix and they all love it, most even ask to come back when they visit us again!

My favorite is the Brew Milk Tea and my husband gets the Assam Tea.  Both with boba.  The boba is always just right!  Now too soft and it too hard.  

I have also gotten the crepes quite a few times, did I mention I come here a lot?  And the crepes are delicious too!

Overall, it's an excellent place to go!  And if anyone told me they didn't like it my jaw would probably drop to the ground.  I can't imagine a person that drinks boba not liking Brew Tea Bar!"

I had a jasmine and crema. I liked how the jasmine was prepared pour over style. Maybe this is how other places do it but I liked how I this one was done right in front of me. The combo of jasmine and crema was touted to me as a good one to try, but the two together didn't really work for me. If i tried another, maybe I'd go for the cold brew.

The crepe was nothing special, or at least the way we ordered it, with ice cream and strawberry.

To this day, I'm craving Taro Milk Tea with boba and egg pudding just like the ones they make from Half &a Half in California. I wanna say, they have a better take on it now. 

Anyway, the taro milk tea is my classic favorite as it's subtle in sweetness but the blend of honey boba really accentuate the flavor. Pair with egg pudding and the kick is even more flavorful. I can't ask for anything better in Boba.

Coming from SGV\/626 area of LA I was very spoiled with good boba. Back home, nearly every corner had a decent boba shop. Moving here to Vegas really sucked...I couldn't find decent boba. Most places either undercooked their boba or overcooked it and the places who had good tasting boba had bad tea. It was a struggle for the first few months that I was here.

Thankfully someone introduced me to brew tea and I finally got some decent boba tea again! They cook their boba perfectly how it should taste. It's squishy and chewy but not soggy. As for their milk teas I've tried a variety of different drinks and they've all been good to me. I would say some of them are sweeter than others but it's nothing too much. I recommend ordering 75% sugar your first time (especially on the Hokkaido). Never order their chrysanthemum tea with no sugar unless you know what you're getting yourself into. I also tried their sunset beach drink but I was definitely not a fan of that.

Their service is pretty good here too. I love that they have enough staff working to make drinks fast enough. I can begin to tell you the amount of times that I've been to a store and it doesn't have enough employees to handle the volume..."

I felt that the regular sweetness wasnt overwhelming so A+ to that.  I was also suprised at the amount of lychee jelly they gave me. It was just a heaping amount compared to other boba places Ive tried.  

The workers here are very quick and pays much attention to detail.  Next time youre around the area, stop by and get a drink to cool you down in this heat!"

Pros
-Management and staff provide Excellent customer service because you can see the sense of urgency in every staff, they always offer to change your drink if Unsatisfied and EVERYONE smiles. 
- regardless of long lines out the door.. the team works together very fast and on top of every order.
-Jasmine Milk tea is my Favorite here. You can really taste the fresh brewed tea, cream of gold, perfect sweetness and they DO NOT charge you for No Ice (like Lofttie Cafe does.. Dumbest thing I've heard). 
- boba is perfectly sweet with the right amount of chewiness.


Cons
- I am a big herbal\/grass jelly fan.. however not a fan of How Brew Tea makes it. A few chunks of their Grass jelly gives a very Weird Gritty Unpleasant texture, while some others are normal and smooth. I wish their grass jelly was cut into much larger sizes, more light and very Very soft (Like Kung fu's herbal jelly)

Regardless.. their drinks are addictively good Because you can taste all the fresh goodness that goes inside of it. 
I bet if they created their own Pistachio frappe it would be amazing *HintHint*"

We did the afternoon tour on the strip for a price tag of $125. I have done food tours in other large cities for a lower price point so I was initially a little leery of the cost but this experience was worth every penny. We dined at some of the higher end restaurants on the strip, were served 10+ amazing courses and on top of that received some really interesting information about some of the buildings and architecture on the strip.
Our stops on this trip were at Javier's, Milos, Momofuku and cucina. I honestly couldn't pick a favorite because each of them offered their own unique experience. In addition we stopped at a shop called retro specs which is honestly one of the coolest stores I have ever been to. We got a personalized tour of the store and learned all about the recycling process they use on vintage frames.

They should instead of be focussing on more of a ""foodie"" theme of high quality product with a smaller portion and great presentation.  It would have been nice to have some higher quality proteins  (there was not one fish dish).  Everything was filling but not in a foodie wow what was that I just had experience.

Recently moved to Las Vegas, wanted to learn about the scene on the Las Vegas strip.
Lipsmacking Foodie Tours is a great introduction. You're treated like royalty.  Upon arrival I was promptly greeted by my tour guide Donald.  We gathered as a group and the fun began.

It starts out with a brief history of the architecture, marvelous art collections and celebrity chefs.
It was a short walk to our first stellar destination.
The atmosphere and sublime cuisine of each of the restaurants is par Excellance.  Impeccably presented and served.  Donald made it fun and described each dish in detail.

I highly recommend the beverage package.
Each restaurant has its own signature cocktail that is in perfect balance with the cuisine.

The staff at each location treats you like a VIP.  The service is kind and unhurried with your dishes arriving promptly.

Along the way you are treated to visually stunning art installations, boutique shops and amazing water features.

Our tour guide Donald is the owner of the company.  He clearly knows the food scene in Vegas, and he hand picked each dish.  Some of my favorites were the the shrimp & crab enchiladas at Javier's, the fried zucchini dish at Milos, spicy cucumbers at Momofuku, and the pistachio custard dessert at Cucina. 

Donald stopped briefly in between restaurants to educate us about some of the awesome sculptures and art installations we passed along the way.  He also provided great tips on where else we can eat and where to go for the best view of the strip.

Downtown tour started at Carson's Kitchen.  What surprised me was the Deviled Eggs.  Not JUST deviled eggs.  Crispy chicken skins reminded me of lichen also very delicious.  On to Therapy and their Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle slider.  (Say that 3x fast...mouthful just like the slider).  A sneak peek into a private bar, Inspire...and then on to 7th and Carson.  Saving the best for last.  Their Hearth Oven Bread + Dip 4 ways was absolutely divine.  You can watch them bake the bread in their open pizza oven and see it ""puff"".  Eat it while it's hot!

Donald the owner\/tour guide was very knowledgeable about the spots he showed us. Some of the food was amazing (Milos was fantastic).  Some was mediocre (Mommafuku's ramen was terrific, but their bun was okay, and cucumbers were not great).  We had expected the tour to cover more ground distance wise, so we were a little surprised to spend the tour in two main hotels right next to each other. It might be better to name this a food tasting rather than tour since tour suggests seeing the city\/strip a bit more. One tip is to make sure at each stop, each person receives a plate with all the food to try. At one stop it was family style, and Donald served us, which was fine, but at another, it was family style platters with each person helping him\/herself, and it felt a little rushed trying to get a bite with so many other ppl trying to also (that stop didn't seem to have enough food, and it was also the best food, so everyone was excited to try it and scarfed it up).  Also, it would've been nice to know ahead of time where we were headed. I understand it can be fun to keep it a secret, but knowing ahead of time would've helped us plan our other meals and be sure not to overlap. Finally, we totally understood including a journalist on the tour so she could write about it, but it would've been nice to have a warning and get permission for her to film us all. The videoing was a bit distracting esp of the food we were excited to eat. I would definitely recommend this tour to others. It's a fun, different way to try some food in Vegas.

Second is that I wish I could give a half star as this tour would likely get 4  1\/2 stars.

We did the downtown food tour on a Friday night.  There were 10 people on the tour and our host was Ray.  This tour stood out as they provided a written list of all the places we were going to, and then a menu sheet at each location.  That is above and beyond in my opinion.

The tour focuses on Fremont East, which is an up and coming portion of downtown Las Vegas east of the Fremont Street experience.  All of the restaurants we went to were delicious small crafted bites.  Overall we had a wonderful time and it was well worth it.

So why only 4 stars?  The biggest reason was the stop at ""Inspire"" which was a beverage only (and mediocre at best beverage) on a very loud balcony of a working theater.  There was no food (it's a food tour right?) and it was so loud it was almost impossible to even hold a conversation.  This was followed by a tour of the container park where there were plenty of spots we could have sampled some independent food and enjoyed the park vs. the walk through.  

So all in all it was very enjoyable except for the one stop - so I had to ding a star for that one."

The final stop, Cucina, was the dessert round (because you gotta save the best for last).  I would definitely take another food tour with Lip Smacking Food Tours if I come back to Vegas!!"

The FINEST cuisine, TOP-RATED restaurants, these are THE places to go. You receive 3 or 4 of their signature dishes at EACH of FOUR restaurants. That's a lot of food, 12 different dishes, but an excellent way to sample the BEST OF LAS VEGAS- as they were named. When I travel to different countries, they arrange my trip schedule and restaurants. I enjoy whenever I have a food 
or cooking tour to learn the recipes of the countries. 
The Lip Smacking Foodie Tour is different, everything is ready for us when we arrive at each restaurant providing plenty of time to relax, a take-your-time-dining and meeting the other guests. The 4 restaurants are in hotels- ARIA, COSMOPOLITAN & CRYSTALS SHOPPING CENTER next to each other. During the tour, the guide is knowledgeable with exciting information about the restaurants and hotels. 
I recommend this tour highly and would like to take both of their other Las Vegas new restaurants tour as well as their evening tour with a helicopter ride!

The first one I did the tour on the Strip with the helicopter finale. Secondly, the Downtown tour which was also good, I just wish I hadn't been late and missed the first restaurant.
This tour is specifically designed to give the guest a taste of the best dishes at each restaurant. You won't get this anywhere else. You'd have to get the full portion if you did this yourself. Their cocktail option which I recommend since I've done it twice is also a great enhancement.
The Strip tour started at the Aria with Bardot Brassiere, then follows with Sage (they have a large collection of Absinthe and that is the cocktail they will give you with a presentation), Milo's at the Cosmopolitan, then Jaleo, and ends with dessert at Wolfgang Puck at Crystals. My favorites dishes were at Sage and Milo's, even though I enjoyed trying the rest of the restaurants as well. Jaleo didn't have any dish that was outstanding to me in flavor but still great creativity (using a shoe as a plate).
Downtown Tour: Started at Carson's Kitchen which I missed but they raved about the Fried Pork Skin, Therapy was delicious (they're known for the Red Velvet Waffle and Fried Chicken Sandwich). Signature cocktail is a Blackberry Smash. You get a bit of facts about downtown and enjoy a signature cocktail at the Insider which had a rooftop balcony (Cilantro Lemonade was delicious). You end at Tumeric which is a new Indian restaurant. They also give you a tour on how they make Naan bread. Very spiceful and flavorful. Signature cocktail is a Sangria.
I can't wait to keep trying these tours. Good job!"

Entirely focused on The Cosmopolitan and City Center, those concerned in any way about a walking tour during the scorching Las Vegas summer not to worry as the only part of the $299.00 per person tour to take part outside is a 150-yard stroll from Crystals to Cosmopolitan and back, the Savors of the Strip portion of the tour begins in front of the arched waterfall in front of Aria Resort and Casino, this and many other pieces of art described by a tour guide who also acts as part-time comedian and server throughout the rest of the night.

Taking on five restaurants in approximately 30 to 45-minute increments as the night progresses, those taking a Sunday tour seeing their adventure begin at Javier's, it is with approximately three menu items as well as Bread Service and a Signature Cocktail that each restaurant is presented with a brief description of the concept and Chef\/Proprietor, the California-based Mexican restaurant proving to be the least generous of the tour as Tortilla Chips and freshly made salsa join two half-Enchiladas plus Beans fortified with Lard and fluffy Mexican Rice.

Given a chance to check out the nation's largest chainsaw sculpture and a tree of top-shelf Tequilas plus a Margarita made with Pineapple and Herradura Reposado before departing, the private dining room typically reserved for Ballers and Movie Stars also a nice touch, stop two features what many including myself consider to be the nation's finest Brasserie just one story above the Aria's gaming environs, Michael Mina's Bardot Brasserie featuring local-Chef Josh Smith serving up two Puff-Pastry Escargot per person along with a pair of Duck Wings and Orange Sauce before finishing up with the bar-menu only Chicken French Dip that remains a hidden secret worth seeking out in Sin City.

Focusing much of the discussion at Bardot on the beautiful bar, the French 75 offered as part of the Tour's $60 supplemental Cocktail package a highlight for three of the five guests imbibing that night, it was after a bit more education about the Art Collection at Aria as well as Crystals that the tour arrived at the Cosmopolitan's dining concourse, Montreal-based Estiatorio Milos experienced for pennies on the dollar compared to their typical menu pricing with a traditional Tomato Salad offered for the timid, while those more adventurous dined on tender grilled Octopus plus Las Vegas' premier Eggplant dish alongside the refreshing Basil Press.

To this point doing a fine job of sating appetites without overwhelming, even those choosing to indulge in the warm Baguette and Butter at Bardot or charred Sourdough and family-secret Olive Oil at Milos, savories conclude by way of Celebrity Chef Scott Conant's Scarpetta within eye-shot the previous restaurant, the majority of the group quick to fade as three signature pastas including one stuffed with Foie Gras were served up alongside two big bowls of Mushroom Polenta plus a basket featuring Focaccia begging to be topped with Mascarpone Butter and Eggplant Caponata plus slices the restaurant's irresistible Stromboli.

Rounding out the Food Tour with something sweet, the recently rebranded Cucina by Wolfgang Puck at Crystals preceded by a lengthy visit to RetroSpecs at The Cosmopolitan where the eccentric owner spent time showing off frames previously worn by everyone from Johnny Depp to Ozzy and Gandhi, those familiar with Las Vegas dining will be thrilled to know that all four of Kamel Guechida's Desserts continue to set a high standard indicative of why Puck lured him away from Joel Robuchon in the first place, the creamy Pistachio Budino and Tiramisu almost as light as a cloud both particularly welcomed after a long night of eating and education.

Not done quite yet, the clock now nearing 9:00pm as a pair of visitors from British Columbia who'd only signed up to dine departed for their hotel, it was following the guide that the rest of the group was led to the underground parking area at Aria, a black tour bus featuring the name Maverick Helicopter Tours soon to arrive and deliver the remaining members plus others guests to the airfield adjacent McCarran Airport, a Champagne Toast found waiting as each guest is discreetly weighed and given a number that the well-trained pilots will soon call out.

At this point only a bit worried that any sudden movement may adversely affect those who'd eaten and drank too much, the pilot calm, funny and in communication with Air Traffic Control at all times, it was with a gentle lurch that the Helicopter containing six adults from as far away as Trinidad lifted skyward, a fifteen minute flight narrated by a recorded voice taking people all the way from Mandalay Bay to The Stratosphere before looping back, the ride as smooth as silk with everyone landing in a broad smile, the pilot even taking a little time to stick around after and take some pictures in addition to the promotional photo available at an extra charge inside the terminal"

They helped him set up an incredible proposal that took place on this tour. I was completely surprised! I highly recommend this tour to anyone that is interested in trying some new foods\/restaurants in Vegas that you would likely not know about. The food was delicious, and the drinks from the drink package we got with our meals paired nicely. I'd also recommend this tour to anyone that'd like to propose to their significant other. With the help of Donald and Ray we were able to enjoy a great tour with great food, drinks and company, and leave the event happily engaged. The helicopter tour afterwards was out of this world. It was the first time either of us had been on one and it was amazing. The view was breathtaking, definitely something to experience at least once in our book. Overall it was an amazing experience that I would love to enjoy again soon."

Our first trip was on the Vegas strip.  We had delicious duck wings, snail, and my favorite minus the desserts was the short rib ravioli.  Our second trip was downtown near the Fremont experience which was great.  We love people watching and listening to the live music there.

We meet at Aria in front of the big waterfall at 2:15 and the rest is history.  This is by far the most well thought out and organized tour we have ever been on.  You can tell Ray, our guide, really is knowledgeable and takes pride in his job.  This was much more then just a foodie tour, it was also a sight seeing your and a history tour of Las Vegas rolled up in one.  Yes the food was wonderful, I wouldn't expect any less.  What I didn't expect was how much fun it would be to get to know everyone in our group and how fun it was that we all got to experience this tour with such a fun group of people.  We tried 16 courses from four different restaurants.  In the end of the tour we discovered that we were fuller after this tour then after the buffet we ate the day before.  We also added the drink package so there was a signature cocktail at each stop.  We will be back to Las Vegas to tryout the down town tour next visit.

There was only one dish I didn't care for, but that was because the piece I took was too salty. Nobody else in our party had that problem, so I think that it was just a fluke.

I would say this was the highlight of my Vegas Trip.  It was either Donnie and Marie show or Don (Foodie tour).

I was solo. Do not be afraid to go alone.  Everyone was friendly. There were 7 on our afternoon tour. I was concerned about all the walking. No problem. The 4 restaurants were split between 2 properties. The properties were next to each other!

Don the host was a peach. Friendly, interactive and knowledgable. He had made arrangements with 4 top of the line restaurants. Each different from the other. The food was wonderful. We had 3 offerings at the first 3. There were 4 at the restaurant we had dessert. 

At home when making a list of restaurants I wanted to try I had crossed off the ones that were on the tour. They were more upscale and pricey. After the tour I realized you get what you pay for. I learned that these restaurants had super fresh food.  Sometimes organic.  They have deals with farms and such to produce high quality for them. After the tour I saw that I would most likely go back for lunch. 

At each place Don told us background about the restaurant. Very interesting. At one we even met the chef. 

As the food digests we walk from place to place.  He pointed out sculptures and gave us interesting information about the hotels and sculptures. Wish I had a photographic memory when it came to the information. We also stopped in a high end optical store.  One of the employees explained the concept and showed us frames. Very interesting.

I much of a drinker and I took the drink package.  Wise decision. It is a little more but glad I did.
I hate to give spoilers however my favorite place was Javier's.
I feel that Don makes the tour his life. He strives for best food, best service and makes sure everything goes smoothly. My next trip to Vegas will include  Lip Smacking Foodie Tour.  I may do an evening tour or possibly a Downtown tour. Take your tour at the beginning of your stay. That way you can go back to the restaurant.

They tell you to pace yourself foodwise. Helloooooo... Do it! Inevitably you enjoy the food and eat too much."

My boyfriend and I had an awesome time on the Downtown Lip Smacking Tour.  We are Las Vegas Locals and I have lived here for 20 years and my boyfriend, almost ten.  Not only did the tour take us to some great restaurants, Ray (our awesome tour guide), took us to several hidden gems and secret spots that we didn't even know about!  This tour is not just tasting food at different restaurants... it was an EXPERIENCE! I'm not going to give anything away because I don't want to take away from the surprise and delight the tour offers.

I had been to two of the three restaurants on the tour but I had an opportunity to try things I would never have ordered, like the Fried Chicken Skins with Smoked Honey at Carson Kitchen.  I'm still dreaming about them!  
Wear comfortable shoes because other than when you are sitting down eating, you will be walking around downtown.  

The timing of the tour was great too as we were able to hang out downtown and take it all in afterwards.

I'm on their mailing list and each week they send out that week's ""Additions"" which are basically the specials for the week (Wednesday through Sunday).  My taste buds and I are always amazed at the new offerings each week, and more often than not that's what I get.  

This week's additions included a pork loin stack that was incredible. It had blackened pork loin medallions on top of a potato and onion hash and topped with eggs over easy and a tomato-spiked Hollandaise sauce. They finished the meal with a complimentary warm cookie topped fresh whipped cream. 

This is an excellent spot to meet your friends and family for weekend brunch. If you get there before the rest of your party you can enjoy a cup of coffee in their lounge area while checking out the small photo gallery. They serve a Primo Columbian coffee and the servers always keep your cup full. 

They are very adept at handling large groups as well. I arrived one morning just after a party of 14 had been seated, and despite my fears that I was in for a long wait for my meal, I was served just as promptly as always. If you have a large group they will take reservations. 

If you have a sweet tooth be sure to try the cinnamon rolls. Be warned, however, they are huge so you'll probably want to share. The breakfast burger and the eggs Benedict are also excellent choices. The chef makes each order of Hollandaise sauce when you order your meal, so if there is something on the additions menu that includes Hollandaise sauce, go for it!"

We ordered the tri tip on a baguette, nacho style fries, quinoa vegan burger, and cookies and cream for dessert. The tri tip sandwich and quinoa burger was amazing. Even the salad you can tell all the veggies and ingredients were carefully picked out. There were no bruises on any of the greens, I was so surprised! The chef came up to us and made sure we were enjoying the food. 

Hands down a place you should check out and see for yourself how awesome this place is."

I would have never found it if it wasn't out of curiosity on why this little cafe, in a neighborhood I'm normally not in, had almost 105 star reviews. Also, with a name like Zenaida's, I would have assumed it was another Mexican style restaurant in Las Vegas. But what it is, is a fabulous fusion of bistro meets new American meets comfort-food. 

The staff is so friendly and welcoming. You really do feel like you're part of a cool family that knows how to cook really well. The atmosphere is kind of kitschy and funky. And the little extras that they give you, like the homemade potato chips with aioli at the beginning to the meal and the cookies with cream at the end, really makes it special. 

It's really kid friendly as well. My girlfriend brings her baby and the staff always googles over her and brings her little animal crackers or fruit to enjoy.

The avocado toast was delicious! The toast, avocado, tomatoes and onion all perfectly blended together to make this one dish.

My sister order the waffle and turkey sausage. The waffle had whip creme and strawberries. It was a yummy and fluffy waffle. The whip cream and strawberries made it even better, I did not even need to use syrup. The turkey sausage cake in 4 pieces. They were a good size and was pretty thick. 

I ordered the chicken breast sandwich. The sandwich was big and it came with fries. It was a pesto chicken sandwich with tomatoes. The chicken pieces were huge which I liked. I was only able to finish half of it. 

They also gave us a complimentary dessert! It was 2 fresh baked cookies. It was soft and it put a smile on my face after the first bite.

We were looking for something off-strip, so we could avoid large crowds, ostentatious buffets and inflated pricing.  I selected Zenaida's on the strength of their Yelp rating, and we were absolutely not disappointed.

Right after we ordered, we were treated to a small plate of house-made chips and ""enchilada aioli"", compliments of the chef.  Not sure what was in the dip, but it was delicious!

We opted to start with the cinnamon bun, which was an absolute delight.  Warm, sweet and sticky, and piled high with a mound of whipped cream.

My wife enjoyed the Sterling breakfast: two eggs made to order, delicious breakfast potatoes and the thickest, juiciest slab of bacon I'd ever seen.  This was precisely the simple breakfast fare we were after, but done with such a high quality that it easily could have been featured in any of the high-end restaurants on The Strip.

I ordered the Eggs Benedict, which was also fantastic.  Eggs done perfectly (I prefer mine scrambled), the same thick-cut bacon, and a well-balanced Hollandaise sauce made for a delicious treat.  This, too, came with breakfast potatoes, which were crispy and MOLTEN LAVA HOT (seriously, be careful here).

After the meal, the chef sent out a plate of buñuelos-esque fried pita chips and whipped cream.  We practically needed to be rolled out of the restaurant.

Prices were extremely modest by Vegas standards, with the full meal for two running just over $30.

The staff at the cafe was friendly and genuinely eager to please.  Service before and during our meal was attentive, with ample refills to my coffee.  There was a slight slump in service when the time came to handle the check, but I am more than willing to let that slide in the face of the excellent experience we had otherwise.

We don't travel to Las Vegas frequently, but I am sure we'll be back here the next time we come around.  In the meantime, please do yourselves a favor and check this place out!"

We pulled up. It looked like a little ""homemade"" Italian restaurant from out front. 

We walked in, and I was utterly confused.  The decor definitely throws you off.  There's this colorful tile that really doesn't do much for the space, and an awkward lounge spot right near the front door with fake fruit in a bowl and everything. Hmmmmm....

We were seated in a 2-top off to the side of the room.  The waiter came by to take our drink orders.  I requested a decaf coffee and he quickly responded ""it's instant!"" I scrunched up my nose and politely declined.  ""We will just take a water then..."" This place is not off to a good start.  I didn't know restaurants would ever serve instant coffee in this day & age haha! 

We couldn't quite decide what to get. For me, the menu is really limited.  A lot of bacon \/ pork \/ beef options but I don't eat any of those things.  I settled for the basic breakfast with 2 eggs, turkey sausage, breakfast potatoes and English muffin (even though I can't eat gluten). They don't have gluten-free options.  Chloe ordered the waffle. 

As we waited for our meal, the waitress brought over a pail of homemade chips with garlic aioli. THEY WERE SO GOOD.  Thin, not overly crispy, and seasoned to perfection.  The aioli was good, but it wasn't needed. The chips were amazing as a stand-alone. 

Our food was served quickly.  My eggs were perfect.  I was actually really impressed with how perfectly ""over medium"" they were.  Turkey sausage was just OK.  You can't really rate an English muffin. They are always good haha! 

Chloe's waffle, on the other hand, was INCREDIBLE.  The waffle itself was fluffy, thick and served to the perfect texture. It was covered with homemade whipped cream that I think was sprinkled with cinnamon.  There were fresh cut strawberries covering the top of the waffle.  It was soooooooo good.  She didn't use any of the syrup provided. The whipped cream was just the perfect sweetness to compliment the waffle. On the side, Chloe opted for the thick-cut bacon. She said it was amazing. 

After our meal, they brought out some homemade cookies complements of the chef. The cookies were topped with their homemade whipped cream. The cookies were warm and delicious.  We took 2 to go, shared one at the table.  Wow. 

The service was decent. The chef came out to touch tables before we were served, but had he come out after we ate, I would have thanked him for such a perfect meal.  With all of the chain restaurants and stuck-up chefs on the strip that just leave their name on the marquee while rarely making an appearance, I appreciated the fact that this chef came out to greet his guests and ask how everything is tasting. 

I'm not sure if\/when we can go back because it's clear across town, but this place deserves the 5 star rating it has.  Don't be thrown off by the decor.  It's really not an issue if the food is THAT delicious!"

We were greeted by the waitress and chef. Both checked on our group after we tried the food to make sure everything was up to our liking. All our plates were cleared once we finished. Refills were offered in a timely manner. The chef gave us a complementary dessert which was probably the best thing I've ever tasted. This is my new breakfast spot. Lanore was the sweetest and very attentive. Thank you for the awesome experience! You guys are awesome!

Its a quaint little place with all the gourmet flavors you could ever want. When you first arrive you are greeted immediately...we had a party of 7 i was surprised they got us seated within 5 min. Once we got to our table they took our drink orders... Shortly thereafter they took our food orders ,..while we waited for our food to arrive they brought us free homemade potato chips with a homemade aioli sauce... The sauce was so good my 2 year old grandson tore it up and he can be a picky eater. They also gave us a complimentary avocado toast because another party ordered it inadvertently. It was delicious.. Avocado was fresh..ripe cherry tomatoes ..only wish we had a little more of that balsamic vinegar they splashed on top... My shrimp and grits arrived. Omgoodness it was scrumptious.. And there was plenty of grits i had enough to bring home for dinner. My party also ordered the clam chowder if you like meaty hearty clams this is definitely the meal to get... Everyone in our party was pleasantly happy with their order. As a grand finale they served each of us a pumpkin bread pudding with a side of whipped topping... It was definitely a delightful ending to our meal. My boyfriend doesnt like pumpkin and even he ate the entire dessert. The chef personally approached us to thank us for coming. Customer service was top notch. I gave this place 5 stars ...the only thing i think they could work on is making sure all the food comes to the table at the same time. My daughter waited about 10 mins after we were served for her chicken wings to arrive.other than that they are top notch.. My family and i will definitely be coming back!!"

The food is absolutely delicious. I loved the great service and the way they kept checking up on us making sure we were fine. I got free coffee when I mentioned Yelp. I wanted to order more food from the menu because everything looked so good. I decided to get the Eggs Benedict and couldn't be more happier with my decision. My girlfriend got the Sausage Monte Christo and let me try it. Both plates are very tasty and fill you up. There was no more room in my stomach for more food even though I wanted to try more things. I'll be back for then though. I highly recommend this place to anyone. The service really deserves 5-stars. Can you believe the chef came out to say thank you for stopping by and he hoped we liked the food. AND... we even got a dessert for free. What else could you ask from a restaurant? Come here!!

We both ordered omelettes-they were fluffy and hot. I have a comment regarding this though: the menu says you can have 3 items in your omelette but it has no list of choices. 
So I ordered the standard ham and cheese. The chef forgot my ham. So I had eggs and cheese. It was ok. I did point it out and they sent out some warm cookies for us.

Brought wife here on Sunday morning just after they opened and she had a bit of time trying to find it from the outside.  It is in a shopping center on Trop & Pecos but with minimal and  I mean very little advertising so you know it has to be good if mostly only locals talk about it.

A very small place on the inside with about seats for 40-50 people compared to your major breakfast places that try to herd em in like cattle.  I got the tofu scramble as I am vegetarian and wife got the chicken & waffles with a side of eggs which are about as good as you will anywhere else.  And when I got up to pay,  our server told us to hang out a bit as there was something special coming which was the previously mentioned apple cobbler sampler as a dessert.  Excellent surprise.  What truly truly makes this place special is the attention to detail including what is on the menu and what they are out of or alternative choices.

Not that I needed any changes made to my order, but I'm sure he'd be willing to accommodate to any modifications. His eggs benedict was one of the best I've ever had for breakfast, and I think I'll be skipping lunch and possibly dinner too because of how filling the meal was. The eggs were perfectly poached the way I liked (meaning that when I popped the center with my fork, the yolk gushed out in all its glorious-gooey creaminess), and even though I prefer thin bacon, the thicker and meatier bacon that came with the eggs was very flavorful.  The side of breakfast potatoes were just as tasty, lightly salted, and slightly crisp.  I wish I didn't have to wait a several more hours for my stomach to digest before I can dig into the homemade cinnamon roll that I also ordered to-go... Look for Zenaida's Cafe right next to the State Farm insurance office.

Sooo, a few weeks later... I went back to grab just a small lunch of chicken wings and a side of fries, but my 'quickie' lunch turned into a mini feast of 2 generous portions of freshly cooked fries (I didn't know plain fries came with my order of wings, but the garlic rosemary fries were too tempting to pass up), 7 pieces of succulent, Southern style wings with hot sauce and homemade bbq sauce on the side, and an unexpected complimentary cookies n cream (thank-you-Chef-for-ruining-my-diet) dessert which I gladly made extra room for in my already full stomach!

Zenaida's is the complete opposite. It's the kind of place that makes you want to kick yourself for not going there sooner. 

The location and signage makes it a little hard to see and find. I first saw it when we went to Taco y Taco. We decided to stop by today for breakfast and the restaurant was decently busy. Jazz music was playing in the background. We ordered the avocado toast to start, my boyfriend had the biscuits and gravy and I had the tofu scrambled. Along with our avocado toast the waitress brought out a basket of chips with aioli. The chips seemed homemade, they were thin, salty, and as long as a full potato. 

This was my first experience having avocado toast and it was unreal. The garlic of the toast blended perfectly with the creamy avocado and the tomatoes were juicy. It was a perfect starter and I officially know what the hype is with avocado toast.  

Now my boyfriend gets biscuits and gravy pretty much everywhere that offers it. This biscuits and gravy blew his mind. He is convinced it's the best he's ever had. The gravy wasn't white and coagulated, it was full of sausage chunks. The biscuits were dense and split in two so there was a great balance of gravy to biscuits. To top it off they add hot links! This reminds me of how every breakfast in Alaska comes with reindeer sausage. I could have just eaten the hot links as a breakfast. 

By the time I got to my tofu scramble I was pretty full already. The scramble was presented on a long plate in a log formation, similar to how fried rice is served. It was full of huge chunks of broccoli, cauliflower, rice, and mushrooms. If you don't really like tofu, go ahead and get this scramble because it's very well hidden and it's basically like a breakfast vegetable fried rice. My favorite part was the furikake and nori tucked inside. 

The meal ended with a warm chocolate chip cookie for both of us. My boyfriend was seriously smiling the entire time we were there. We can't wait to come back and try everything from the zucchini fries to the monte cristo to the chicken wings. Best hidden gem in the neighborhood!"

It seems that I'm on a never-ending quest to find that quaint little local breakfast\/brunch place that is simultaneously no frills and spectacular. Also, said place must not be overrun. A hidden gem, if you will.

There are a million breakfast and brunch options in this town and most of them are doing a fine job. Few are going above and beyond. Zenaida's is one of the few.

I don't go out for breakfast all that often, despite most of my bookmarks being for breakfast places. I love breakfast. I'm just not too keen on the that side of noon. So, when I am going out to breakfast it becomes a big decision as to where to go. I had had Zenaida's bookmarked for a while, and only put it on my to try list because it was close by with 5 stars on Yelp. 

When we arrived we received a warm greeting. We were instructed to sit anywhere we liked. Within a few minutes the server took our drink order and while she was gone to get them, a 2nd server stopped to make sure she had been over and drinks were on the way. It made me feel like they had a lot of team mentality to ensure the customer was always taken care of.

We weren't super hungry so we decided to share a cinnamon roll & the chicken in waffles. After we ordered they brought is house made chips with a bloody Mary aoli. Honestly, I can't think of any other breakfast places with give you something like this at breakfast. Plus, it was really delicious. I don't even like aoli, but I was all over this. The chips we're fantastic.

 My husband is a bit of a cinnamon roll connesieur, and this one did not disappoint! Not only was this cinnamon roll fresh and delicious, but it had a beautiful presentation that I just wasn't expecting from a little whole in the wall breakfast place. Every time I go to Zenaida's, this will be a must. Fresh baked & served warm.

The chicken & waffles, which aren't normally my thing, we're also great. I like my chicken crispy and this was crispy with a hint of sweetness. The waffle tasted great, but I would have preferred that to be crispy as well, and it was more on the cakey side.

As a special treat, we were given warm gooey chocolate chip cookies from the chef at no charge. A completely unexpected, but extremely appreciated surprise. They were amazing.

While we ate, I was listening to the next table over talking about Zenaida's food. It appeared to be a family of 1\/2 locals and 1\/2 visiting from parts unknown. The locals were raving about the food and said their Mac n Cheese ""the most decadent thing you'll ever eat"".

I don't know why I dragged my feet checking this place out, but I've been fantasizing about that cinnamon roll, and I can't wait to go back.

Zenaida's is clean, the food is great, and the service is outstanding."

Zenaida's was a great pick because they have dishes for meat eaters and some vegetarian choices, as well. I'm talking well thought out items, not the usual afterthought dishes that you get from most establishments. 

I was torn between the scrambled tofu dish with rice and the breaded\/fried eggplant lettuce cups. I ended up ordering a dish off the weekly specials list, the Vegan Stack. Grilled onions and shredded potatoes were layered with two jerk-rubbed, grilled tofu steaks. Chopped tomatoes and red onion topped the stack for a good mix of raw and cooked veggies. Everything was well seasoned and full of flavor. The jerk spice made that dish. 

During our meal, the chef stepped out to greet and thank us for joining them for breakfast. Along with the service from our sweet server, I'd say they provided us with an excellent overall dining experience. 

After our meal, we were presented with two warm chocolate chip cookies, adorned with whipped cream and caramel drizzle, compliments of the chef. I cannot think of a sweeter gesture than this. The cookies were just the way I like them, soft and chewy; simple and comforting, all at once. The care and attention we received felt like we were dining at a family member's home. This little gem is the perfect reason to support local, independent businesses."

WOW, my taste buds have been forever altered. My wife had the chicken and 
waffles. Seriously, c'mon, are you guys this good at everything? I didn't try the chicken, but the waffles were amazing! Truly worth it just for the waffles alone. But don't forget the Avocado Toast. I had the Mac and Cheese with gator style sausage. I was disappointed, that there wasn't more! I was stuffed about 2\/3 the way through it but I just couldn't stop eating that creamy, slightly spicy, bowl of nirvana! I haven't even told you about the cookies the chef sent out when we were done! Real whipped cream, soft, gooey cookies. Still warm!

They serve wonderful homemade potato chips instead of bread as a complimentary appetizer. I tried the tri-tip Philly cheese steak. It was delightful. The beef was well seasoned and prepared. The caramelized onions and cheese toppings were great. The home made french fries were also very tasty. The price seemed much too low for the amount and quality of food. I recall a total cost of ~$15 before tip for the entree and coffee. Most patrons left with boxes of leftovers. I ate too much and finished mine. The personnel were very pleasant with the perfect level of attentiveness. The Chef came out to see that I liked the food. I will definitely return here. I am hopeful that they are making enough money to stay in business. They don't sell any alcohol, so a traditional high markup item isn't available to them.

A bookmark that I had wanted to go to for a long time. The time is now (or then).

I've always loved omakase's. You're basically telling the chef, ""You do what you want, and I'll take it"". Take it, I shall. After my first omakase experience at Kabuto, I was dying to try some others. Hearing from fellow reviewers, I was intrigued about this spot. When the opportunity came, I embraced it. 

This place is located in an interesting position in Vegas. It's kinda like between Summerlin and Chinatown. The interior is splendid. It's cool, yet modern.

Onto the food. First, I gotta say. They use the top shelf ingredients you can buy. From the fish, to the rice, to the everything else, it was superb. Not only do they have top quality ingredients, but they have top quality chefs working on them. Expertly cooked foods, and precise techniques of cutting... it was spectacular. What I liked was watching the chefs in action, because unlike most other sushi restaurants in town, Chef Hiroyoshi is doing a lot of interesting and unique stuff when it comes to preparing and serving dishes, it's not just rolls and nigiri, the chefs are doing lots of cool,different stuff.

Our server was fantastic and I couldn't ask for anything better.

I dined here for lunch on a Thursday in September, a few hours before my flight home. The restaurant was somewhat slow for that day, but I didn't mind as I was looking for a relaxed lunch.

The waitress kindly explained the menu to me, indicating how their focus is primarily on omakase ($100\/pp). Being somewhat short on time I just ordered items a la carte. I started off with the toro tartar, a nice portion of fatty tuna with house-made soy, a quail egg and crispy wontons on the side. I really loved this dish, and the price of $8.

This restaurant of course specializes in authentic edo mae style sushi, which the chef has worked with certain fish purveyors to ensure he's consistently getting premium product. The fresh variety of fish is clearly evidenced in  the ""toku-jo"". This sushi dish includes 12 of the best sushi offerings that day, all nigiri style and served with tamago two ways. The waitress carefully took the time to explain each piece of fish to me, even jotting down the names of some of the unfamiliar fish so that I would remember them. I've never had sushi this fresh, so incredibly delicate where the subtleties of each fish shines. It was absolutely fantastic.

The sushi was so good that I still just wanted more so I proceeded to also order the toro taku roll, a perfect taste and textural combination of fatty tuna, scallion and pickled daikon radish. The waitress also recommended I would like their version of black cod, prepared with house-made miso and slowly grilled over embers. The result is just the most buttery texture and delicious rendering of black cod I've ever had. My meal finally concluded with the house green tea, the perfect palette cleanser after a phenomenal dining experience (the tea was excellent too btw). 

Some other quick notes, the waitress who helped me that day could not have been more pleasant. We discussed everything from world travel to where the chef sources his fish. She made sure I was taken care of throughout the meal. Further, the prices here are an absolute bargain as far as I'm concerned given the quality of the fish and just overall authenticity. I will most certainly be back for the omakase the next time I'm in Vegas!"

Yes. I'm giving Hiroyoshi a TWO-STAR rating because I left the restaurant disappointed and unsatisfied. 

My disappointment:
- It was over-priced for what I got. When the cost of dinner for two starts to creep upwards to the $200-mark, my expectations are just as high. Before I go on, I much emphasize that I LOVE omakase menus because I am (most of the time) very pleased with what the chef presents. I will not specify what was served in the omakase menu because I respect the chefs and will leave future patrons that surprise. However, I was not pleased with the quality of the ingredients and the taste. Food textures were not complimented, flavors weren't emphasized enough.
- The price. I'm no stranger to expensive meals. I'm not stranger to sushi or Japanese cuisine. At the end of our dinner, the tab was $205 and I still tipped just shy of 20%. Why? Because the service was really good...a little too good.
- The pace. The best part about omakase experiences is that I would get to enjoy the hard work and mind of the chef. However, in order to do that, one must need the time. The courses came out in speedy fashion. Hardly giving us the time to contemplate the previous serving. It was RUSHED. PRESSURED. CHEAPENED. The servers were VERY nice and observative.

Unsatisfied:
- The Omakase menu was upsetting as far as taste and quality. Again, the textures were troubling, the flavors were bland, and the quality was sub-par.
- I expected a bit more food when the server came to our table and said, ""okay that was the last course. Dessert is next."" I asked to order a hand roll because...well... I was still hungry.
The best things about my experience: The employees (even though they performed like an F1 pit crew when moving on to the next course) 10\/10. The presentation of the courses 9\/10. There is definitely hard work and effort in the presentations.

Final thoughts: Go to and eat at Hiroyoshi. Give it a try. Hopefully you will enjoy yourself and have a pleasant time. I will not go eat there again."

My boss and I dined here and he was treating me out for my 26th birthday so we ordered the omakase plus extra sushi. 

I came in here around 9pm and first thing I noticed was that there were not that many fishes available for some reason and I believe this contributed to how small our sushi pieces were. I felt like the chef gave us only what he had remaining and had very few premium fish left. The quality is decent, (nothing that amazing) and the portions were extremely small. I believe the waitress was the chef's wife and she was extremely nice to us even telling the chef to give some service since it was my b-day and we came out from LA just to try this place.. Chef told her okay, but it never ended up happening. Just for my boss and I we spent close to $400 including drinks for very mediocre sushi and will definitely not return. Don't even know what to recommend because nothing really stood out.

Overall subpar sushi, decent service, low quantity, and very expensive. Not sure if it's because I just came at a bad time when the chef had no good premium fishes left, but my experience here was nothing but horrible. Not sure how this could be rated 5-stars, but I will not return to give it another shot. Omakase in LA was much better and cheaper than the one here."

Now before I start, they use Hokkaido uni.
Their green tea is from the matcha powder, not the canned green tea.
They use fresh wasabi, scrubbed off of shark skin, which is on the plating. 
Plating! They do put a lot of effort into their plating, which is great if you're a picture taker.
They had Ikezo Peach (jelly sake). You're literally drinking jelly.

Great service! Dish explanation was a given, but what caught me was that they provide clean wash towels in between the courses, for your hands. (Omakase)

I tried the Omakase and I conclude that it was worth the price. It did suck the life out of my wallet, to be totally honest with you.

Very charming and authentic Japanese restaurant. Highly recommend their omakase. We decided to skip the popular Nobu to give this place a try. There was a bit of a hiccup when we arrived, because the hostess thought that we requested a table, when we really wanted bar seating. Totally makes a difference in your omakase experience. Luckily, they were very understanding and we only waited ~10 minutes for seats to open up at the bar. 

They offer a $85 and $100\/pp omakase. We were feeling bougie and went for the $100 option. We requested to go straight for the nigiri and sashimi, skipping the appetizers. Everything tasted so fresh -- from the fish to the grated wasabi with shark skin. Standouts were the chutoro, otoro and striped jack. The chefs did an excellent job crafting each of our sushi pieces and explaining where each fish came from. Before we got into dessert, the chef graciously allowed us to have a second serving of anything we tried. 

I loved how ended our meal with tomago made two ways -- traditional version and a sweet, cake-like version. My favorite was the latter."

We had planned on one of the Iron Chef restaurants (I am deliberately not naming it here, but the Yelp reviews were so poor we decided instead to find a well-rated Japanese restaurant on Yelp and all your wonderful and informative reviews brought us to Hiroyoshi's!!!) 
We ended up going back two consecutive nights for dinner and would have gone back a third, but that was the night they were closed for the week. 
The sashimi was delicious, fresh and so artfully arranged. We tried a varied and wide array of both sushi and shasimi and EVERYTHING was a treat!! 
Kei waited on us much of the time we were there, and Austin and a few other wonderful staff were very present and helpful throughout, everyone was kind and very, very quick and efficient.

There is a lot of refinement for the price in Sushi Hiroyoshi's Omakase offerings! This is a very strong 4.5 stars.

We first came in over a year ago and ordered several al-a-carte items. We were impressed and wanted to come back, but it was our most recent visit, when my love and I decided to do Omakase, where the true beauty of Sushi Hiroyoshi really shined through--dishes were grounded in their ingredients, but Chef Hiro artfully expanded from there with touches of finesse that were rightfully celebrated with our eyes and mouths. 

Hiroyoshi offers two omakase options: $85 & $100. The omakase is most similar to spots like Nobu and Tokyo Boys. It is Nigiri-heavy, but includes other savory items, like Teriyaki Foie Gras, Grilled Shrimp with egg yolk and uni butter, and Uni Tempura. Sushi Hiroyoshi is vastly better than Nobu, and while we were not quite presented with as large of a volume of high-quality items at Hiroyoshi as we were at Tokyo Boys, there was a little more attention to detail and technique evident when we came to Hiroyoshi...case in point, the Teriyaki Foie Gras was one of the better versions of Foie Gras I've had in Vegas. Additionally, the Nigiri Course was dominated by premium selections that included: Shima Aji, Golden Eye Snapper, Chutoro, Otoro, Abalone, and even included a couple of sushi selections that you won't find at most omakase's...It was my first time trying Hakkaku\/Sailfin Poacher.

We are already planning a return trip...for omakase of course!"

Was it worth it? I think yes, for the most part.  It is definitely a nice commute from the Strip but a great option if you're tired of the touristy parts of Vegas.

We'd made advanced reservations for the sushi bar a couple weeks ahead.  They do seem to want you to pick an omakase ahead of time so we went with the $100 one.  (""We have omakase, $85 and $100.""  Me: ""Ok"" ... awkward pause .. ""Um, which one would you like?"")

We arrived slightly early but our spots were already waiting for us.  They didn't seem too busy, anyway (Saturday night).  They confirmed our selection of the $100 omakase and took our drink orders and then we waited for the eating to commence.

Based on the photos I've seen on Yelp, they stick to a script with their omakase.  I liked almost everything but it was a script nonetheless. They didn't really ask us about preferences (I would have said no mackerel) but other than that, I was down for everything put in front of us.

Presentation is stunning as you can see in the photos.  Fish was fresh and well seasoned.  I poured only a couple drops of soy sauce at once point for the sashimi.  

Service was great and they presented us with beautiful desserts afterwards.  We were quizzed on where we were from and how we found out about them.  They weren't so surprised to hear that I had Yelped them but were very thankful we made the time to go.  There was one server who talked our ear off - very very nice but I could tell the sushi chefs were trying to will her back to her spot in the corner lol.

Definitely a great experience and if I lived in the neighborhood, this would undoubtedly be our regular sushi place.  I hope they stick around for a long time."

Maybe because I live in Los Angeles and I'am spoiled when it comes to sushi.

Las Vegas does not have great sushi, ok maybe, but not great; not even on the strip. This establishment was just Meh.  Owner, wife, and staff very friendly, they get 5 stars.

I had practically everything on the menu, Nigiri only.  they baste every nigiri with some kind of sauce, and that's ok, but everyone?  I had to tell the chef to not do that anymore, and use lemon and salt or with shiso leaf, etc etc. these sauces like ponzu, and others mask the taste of the fish.  That's when you know the fish may be substandard.

This is some of the fish I had cant remember them all

yellowtail belly-good
chu toro- ok
o-toro - ok
salmon- good
snapper- ok
golden eye snapper- ok
yellowtail- meh
spicy tuna roll(very spicy) ok
scallop- ok
amberjack- ok

So, Iike I said nothing stood out except the yellowtail belly,  plus the cuts were very small, tasted more of the rice than anything else.  Considering that we went on a thursday and our group of (6) were the only ones there,  they should have catered to us a little better as far as the portion size.

I probably wont be back.
I'll keep on looking in vegas, but I just dont think I will find the caliber of fish like I find in Los Angeles."

I did the $100 omakase and everything was good! The only thing that I didn't like was our sashimi plates were combined. We were given 3 pieces of fish each which made it hard decide who gets the last piece. The nigiri platter was my favorite which had otoro and chutoros! The dessert was amazing. The creme bulee had a thick sugar crunch and heavy whipped cream. 

I definitely did leave still hungry and we even had to order more sushi after our meal. I would recommend trying this place once if you haven't been before!"

The sushi pieces price ranges from $4-10ish which were very reasonable for the quality of them. Not only the sushi itself but detail of presentation as well as ease of eating were very well executed. 

Bottles of sake are also reasonable. It's just perfect to enjoy with fresh fish or delicate Japanese dishes.

I dined at Sushi Hiroyoshi about a year ago for a la carte items, but this time my love had a reservation for Omakase...these are the items we indulged with:

Appetizer Course:
- Tamago w\/ spinach & mushroom and Jellyfish w\/ Japanese cucumber 
- Grilled Shrimp w\/ egg yolk & Uni butter, Marinated Tuna w\/ Wasabi and Uni Tempura w\/ Mushroom & Green tea salt
- Sashimi Course
- Teriyaki Foie Gras w\/ poached radish, lotus root & golden flake

Nigiri Course:
- Hakkaku aka Sail fin poacher
- Shima Aji aka Striped Jack
- Golden eye Snapper 
- Chutoro
- Otoro
- Abalone 
- Santa Barbara & Hokkaido Uni

Desesert Course:
- Creme Brûlée & Green Tea ice cream 

Sushi Hiroyosi seats quietly in a very unassuming area...by a nail salon that certainly looks decent and an un-popular eatery...yet it is its own legend amongst sushi lovers in Vegas. Chef Hiro San along with Kenssan deliver an amazing and memorable meal.

The head chef\/owner shows a high level of care in every plate he presents.  My wife and I usually choose to have their sashimi plate which differs in quantity and selection depending on the price (in $20 increments).  They also have two different sushi plates which has 12 to 15 different pieces of nigiri to sample and enjoy.  They also have an omakase offering for $100 which is absolutely wonderful in terms of freshness and quality.  Finally, they also offer a variety of izakaya-style plates which we like to choose from to supplement our sashimi\/sushi selections.  They also have a decent offering of different sakes and they have Sapporo on draft - the best!

The owners (head chef and his wife) are super nice and welcoming.  Their wait staff are great as well - friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.

It's located in a strip mall and you will just see a ""Sushi"" sign until you actually pull in and see the name on the window.  There are very few tables here and a sushi bar seating area. We had a party of 10 on a weekday, and had no problems with our reservation. 

The sashimi was SO fresh! You can order by piece or one of the set combination meals. We tried the jewel box, dragon roll, soft shell crab roll, and uni tempura. I'd say the rolls are pretty standard (but still good), uni tempura is mostly just tempura, and the jewel box was delicious. There was a good mix of sashimi, rice and pickles. 

Our friends got the omakase, which looked amazing! There was so much food and multiple courses including tofu, sashimi, sushi, cod, and dessert. Definitely order for your whole table if your budget allows, so that everybody can enjoy the meal progression together. We all ordered separately so the a la carte people finished a lot earlier than the omakase meal."

I came here last week and enjoyed a delicious ""Hawaiian"" style burger only to find out they closed the doors a day later? Nope, this place just has funky hours and sometimes the chef is out running errands. So take it easy Yelpers, only report a place as closed if you see a, ""Closed For Business"" sign. That being said... When I walked up to the shack no one was there, I waited for a bit and turned to leave just as the chef came running up, close call Pepito! 

Taking over the former Goodwich food shack, Pepito offers more of a blue collar, culture rich menu with solid flavor profiles, but with less food finesse. That being said, my burger was juicy, spicy and deliciously messy. An inch thick patty, piled high with onion rings, grilled pineapple, teriyaki sauce, I added fresh sautéed jalapeños and avocado. By the way, no cheese on this bad boy and I'm still in love, the layered flavors were highlighted with each bite and kept me eating with no breathing breaks, who needs oxygen! 

Carl's Jr. and most boutique burger joints in Vegas have nothing on this burger. Pepito!, fix your hours, stay consistent and you're sure to have a line around the corner. 

If you grill it, they will come."

2. The owner was amazing. He came out and talked to us and gave us, what he calls, ""American Churros"" on the house. These American Churros are delicious deep fried Oreos with just enough cinnamon on top for you to say, ""Damn, these are seriously American Churros. So fitting!"" 

3. The owner made the effort to bring us our food and treat us with care. He engaged with us and we had a lovely conversation. You can really tell he loves what he does with every bite.

As always I took to my yelp reviews not being from this side of town and wanted something all the locals liked.

Then I found Pepitos. I read the reviews and decided this was hot spot destination for lunch. 

Richard, I beleive is the owner was very friendly and gave me several options as to what to order. After talking to him and reading other reviews I opted for the beef pepito, no extras but did ask for the garlic sauce. The sauce gave the sandwich that infamous taste that upon first bite your eyes roll back in heaven.
I enjoyed my 15 minutes out on a beautiful sunny March afternoon with good eats and company from Richard ( the chef) himself. Awesome food and even more awesome company. Thank you Richard"

I am not sure what the hype is about because it's definitely A-OK. I ordered a rotisserie taco and slow cooked & smoked pork taco; both had cilantro, onions, mild salsa, and some sorta of cheese. The meat itself are flavorless, dry, and drenched in juices that made the tortilla super soggy and fall apart. The only pro was that they were generous with the amount of meat so I was full with 2 tacos.

SERVICE
It was empty on a Saturday afternoon, so I didn't have to wait to order. The same girl who took and made my order also checked me out at the register. She was nice, made suggestions, and tried to engage in a convo so I appreciate it.

AMBIANCE
Very modern, plenty of seatings, and wood themed.

I probably won't return because the tacos are not as flavorful compared to other places, and are somewhat overpriced."

I liked that they make their own tortillas, but was a little disappointed that they didn't warm them up on a griddle prior to serving. This place operates similar to Chipotle where you choose your base, meat and toppings. Most of the food is already cooked so when you order its pretty much just assembling your food. The chicken was a little dry. Pork taco had the best flavor and steak was good. Salsas were really good. Got both red salsas. The spiciest salsa I felt was a little on the salty side. The other red salsa was a chunkier salsa with better flavor. They have this killer green sauce similar to the green sauce you get when you order Peruvian food made up of cilantro, jalapeños, mayo and I'm sure a lot more. Breakfast platter was okay. Nothing really stood out to me. Overall a tasty restaurant, but not sure I would go out of my way to eat here when visiting Vegas."

Husband and I literally eat tacos every week in San Francisco.  We've had them in Mexico on food tours, all over California and other parts of the US.  I wouldn't call myself a taco expert but feel like I have a good point of comparison.  

This place literally put the most love into my slow roasted pork tacos.  They scrambled eggs to add, grilled cheese on a plancha to add (OMG!) and had beautiful home made salsas.  The owner(?) took his time explaining and talking with us about them and they were a work of art.  I would venture to say that these were the best tacos I've ever had.

The owner was present and very friendly and accommodating . The options for vegetarians are more than most restaurants offer. We had the vegetarian burrito. I highly recommend getting an over easy egg inside. They even grilled the shredded cheese before putting it into the burrito and the crispiness that this created along with the grilled golden flavor gave the burrito a very unique flavor. I would highly recommend the organic soda, the cherry creme soda was our favorite. Fresh, flavorful, and filling! Definitely discovered a new favorite place to visit when in Vegas and already craving the burrito!  Extremely kid friendly as well. We were here at closing time and they still treated us like royalty. If there is ever a wait it would be worth it."

I tell him I'm waiting for my wife's order. He asks ""what did she order?""  ARE YOU F@$KING KIDDING ME? There is no one here and when people do come in you serve others first? You forget a simple order? You tell a new and never again customer to go screw himself! Nice!!

As pizza lovers, we usually try to hunt down the best pizza joints around the area. We've tried Carmine's before so we decided if there would be a better spot and we're glad that we stopped by Niko's after browsing a few pages on Yelp. 

Let me start that I'm usually very picky when it comes to pizza. I can tell if the toppings and the dough they use is either fresh or the typical preserved garbage. 

We stopped by for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday night. Niko and his server greeted us and made us feel very welcome. The place is very simple with a cantina vibe to it. Very cozy and nothing too fancy. First thing we noticed is that Niko is very passionate on what he does and when it comes to his pizza, he makes no compromises as he tried to explain to us with a little backstory and how he got into pizza making. Customer service is definitely on point. 

My wife and I decided on a large meat lovers. Let me tell you right now that their sizes here are frickin' HUGE. No complaints there and I'll welcome any left overs to take home and pig out later while I'm gaming. 

Be prepared to wait a little bit since they chop everything in house for your order; meats, veggies, etc... If you want fast pizza, go to Pizza Hut. I don't mind waiting for good ass pizza. 

We didn't mind the wait and while they told us it was gonna be awhile, Niko gave us a complimentary Caprese flat bread (I think that's what it's called?) to chow down while waiting. Take note: this is customer service at it's best right here. 

Pizza came around 45 minutes later and boyyy let me tell you right now that this shit is on a different level. The crust\/dough is perfect, the pizza isn't greasy (my pizza pet peeve) and just the right amount of cheese. My fat ass ate 5 slices and my wife ate 2 and we still got left overs ... And if you're a ranch lover like myself , do your self a favor and order a side. It's bomb.com ... 

Closing remarks: My wife and I will definitely be back... That ranch is crack sauce ... I might give delivery a go but I forgot to ask if they deliver by Blue Diamond and Ft. Apache area... Good job Niko and crew and thanks for showing us good pizza."

Placed an order for delivery a little before 6pm. I ordered the niko special, medium, 8 wings with ranch and a calzone with mushrooms, pepperoni, and olives. The yelp confirmation quoted 45-60 minutes. It was 730 and still no food. Gave them a call and the owner apologized and said he was waiting for his driver. Food finally arrived around 740. The pizza dough was tough and overly sauced and the sausage pieces were so small that they just burnt and got hard in the oven. The calzone was missing the pepperoni (which they charge extra for, as they do with all toppings). The wings were the best part but still not great. Owner was very apologetic (which I appreciated) and said they were short handed. That's understandable and maybe the quote from yelp 24 was not entirely accurate so that could be an error on yelps part and not the restaurant. But an apology can't really fix bad food. The whole order was $55 including delivery fee and tip. Which is a lot to spend on bad food. Delivery delay aside, the food itself wasn't good. We just ate some of it cuz we were hungry but probably won't be eating the rest. You don't usually regret deciding to stay in, but we did today! Should have just gone out to pizza rock like we had planned. :("

The pizza itself is tasty with plenty of toppings without being greasy or getting soggy. However, I ordered the pizza at 5:27 p.m. through Eat24. My projected delivery time was 6:44 p.m. I thought it was a long wait time, but appreciated knowing there was a bit of a delay. My pizza arrived at 7:20, without an additional word from the restaurant. My suggestion would be to either eliminate delivery service as an option, as it took an hour and a half for the delivery the first time I ordered, as well. Or, contact the customer and let them know that their delivery will be significantly late. I have worked in the restaurant industry and understand that you can get in the weeds, but you always try to keep your customer informed. The delivery person offered no explanation or word of apology. In fact, had he said ""I'm so sorry!"" I would probably not have even posted this review. I will not be ordering from this restaurant again."

Saw the good reviews for here. Decided to eat in rather than take back to house because of the weather. Greek salad was wonderful, fresh and delicious. Garlic cheese bread very good. Only one guy was working in the back when we are we, it was early on a nasty Sunday evening.  His partner was out on a delivery. We were told that it would be a bit for our order as there were 3 orders ahead of us. That was fine for us and a welcome thing to be told in advance. Pizza was well worth the wait
 Fresh made and tasty. Good ingredients. 5 star food and no deducts for the slow prep on good as the service was friendly and though not fast, we were told so in advance."

If you like fresh ingredients, dough that crackles on the outside and is chewy on the inside of the crust, this is where to start!

Trust me, I've tried basically every place in the 89148 and surrounding areas and have not found a place that gets the crust (tastes like bakery fresh hot bread you would be happy to butter and eat alone!), the cheese (lots of it, white mozzarella thickly coated), and the sauce (rich and tomatoey, with a bit of sweetness and ""tanginess"" if that is a word) as good as I've tasted anywhere in my 6 years in Vegas. I'm originally from the east coast so this reminds me a bit of some of those style pies. I actually met the family when I went in to pick up my pizza and the mom and the pop and the kid and staff were all back there making sure everyone was getting served in time during the busy after work hour (I ordered at 6 pm). The wait was only 50 minutes which sounds like a long time to some people, but these guys have a process to make their pizza and 50 minutes on a Friday night during rush hour is spectacular for this good of a pizza! So to wrap this up- the experience I had talking with this family really impressed me as another small business owner. They are the genuine real-deal kind of business owners we need around here-folks that take care of their customers like they want them for life. It made me wish the absolute best for them in growing their new business. Mediterranean families seem to take great pride in the food they serve to you and that sensibility is not lost here! Mom even gave me some homemade baklava to take home! I have Lebanese background from my mother's side and she wanted to see how I liked it and let's just say they need to put THAT on the menu too! Overall great experience and they will go far if they simply keep the product like it is! I've been here about 6 times now and I'm happy to give them a deserved shout out. Well done"

He then told me he will make my pizza next.   I took a seat and waited 10-15 minutes.

I did a search on Yelp and it gave me several choices all of which I didn't know because my diet has never and never will include Pizza.

Anyway, I saw this place called Nikos Pizza and in all in yelp style I looked at the one with 5 stars knowing that has no real influence of the experience I was about to experience.

The yelp app offered a service called eat24 that would handle the whole lack of character thing with a few thumb taps, so I did it and ordered from Nikos.

As the time went on I thought 'hey, why don't I call Niko and see if my order went out, so I called.

To my amazement, Niko himself answered the phone. He assured me we were in process and thanked me for doing business with him.  I like Niko now. 

Then, a knock at the door and 'whala' a hot piping Niko pizza is at my door. 

It was a great pizza that made me comfortable with my temporary lack of character.

On the website they have a picture of a wood burning pizza oven. So since the picture was on the website I assumed that's the oven from this location. Wrong! They have a conveyor belt oven like the ones mostly associated with the poor quality chain pizza joints.  Pizza was chewy and the onions and peppers were very sparse.  I paid almost $19 for the 14 inch pizza that IMO should be half that amount for the type of pizza you get. I think it's highly unethical to have that picture on your website when you don't have anything close to Woodfire pizza!  Wow I actually just read the rest of your description right above the Woodfire oven of the places that you have consulted\/worked. Those are two of the top 10 pizza places in Vegas and 550 at Aria being #1 in Vegas. Had I read that before ordering and eating your pizza here I would have been even more disappointed. No way you can be in the same stratosphere as those two places with a conveyor belt oven.  I guess you want to keep going with a rude response!  It's a scam that you have a picture of a wood burning oven if you don't have wood fired pizza!!! Prices down 35% off of what?  You have a chain pizza type pizza and you're charging a premium pizza price! You need to learn to take constructive criticism or you have no chance to succeed. The pizza I got was over sauced and had few toppings!  Bottom line there are no quality pizza chefs that would ever use a conveyor pizza oven. That's left for the 16 year old ""chefs"" cooking at Chuck E Cheese. Please name one quality pizza place in town that uses a conveyor pizza oven?  Conveyor pizza ovens are for amateurs and rookies. Name a single place that uses a conveyor pizza oven and charges your prices. I told you that my favorite pizza place in town is five fifty at Aria. Your prices are very comparable to theirs size for size and they obviously have 10 times the overhead as you. I have no problem paying for quality, conveyor pizza is garbage!"

Just realized this is my sons yelp account but that's okay! Was finally able to get my hands on a pie from Niko's pizza got a L pepperoni. The restaurant is so cute and clean. Niko and his brother are hilarious and so polite! The pizza was bombbbbb!! One of the best pizzas I've had in a long time and their ranch is freaking crack so good I could drink it which they told me they make their ranch themselves. New favorite pizza spot will be coming back over and over again for sure! Thanks guys! 







Unfortunately wasn't able to order from nikos today due to having a large order and expected time given but still would like to give a review based of the customer service I received from Niko himself over the phone. Although our conversation wasn't even 5 minutes I appreciate how nice and honest Niko was. I was going to order an XL pizza but given the time frame wasn't able to I really appreciate Niko being honest with me and not just taking my order and money and not give me an actual expectation. I have yet to try the food but have no doubt that it is amazing based off the other reviews will definitely be trying nikos asap!!!!"

Ordering for pick-up was easy peasy and the gentleman who took the order was very accommodating to what we were looking for in a white pizza. We were welcomed by the OWNERS (crazy, I know) with smiles and kindness. The establishment was very clean and well organized, including the floors and what I was able to see of the kitchen. Did I mention that one of the owners was actually prepping and making the food?! The pizza, OMG the pizza, was I kid you not beautiful. My husband and I were hesitant to eat it because of the explicit care that was put in to evenly distributing the uniformly cut toppings and the perfectly even cuts. We also took notice that the bottom of the pizza was clean indicating the oven is also clean- rare find I tell you. The pizza tasted awesome (white pizza). The monkey bread was also very tasty. I have never seen a pizza look like this in real life, only in advertisements. I know you probably think I'm nuts for harping on the pizza's aesthetic qualities, but if you order one you will understand! Everything combined, we will diffidently be regulars. We have been looking for a good pizza place for what seems like decades and I think we found our home. To experience patience and impeccable recommendations while ordering, to feel welcomed upon entering, the care and time put in to the food, the use of quality ingredients, and the fairly priced product all combined is truly a diamond in the rough. We plan on exploring the menu further during our next visit and spreading the word! Thank you for providing such an establishment for the valley!"

You can tell they have a real passion for their pizza. Something you'll never find in a commercialized pizza shop. Thankfully though, the pizza was also amazing. Been here 3 years and tried lots of pizza and this is easily some of the best in Vegas. I ordered a medium - which was actually a little bigger than I was thinking it would be - with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, onion, and fresh mozzarella and every ingredient tasted high quality and was put together perfectly.

Me and my boyfriend have ordered from Niko`s twice, both times 5-10 minutes prior to them closing (yes, we`re those customers). When I came in today, I was apologetic because I know how it feels when you`re getting ready to leave and get that last order. But they have reassured me that as long as they are in the restaurant, I do not need to hesitate to call and order. The customer service is amazing, and just the whole atmosphere is so warm and welcoming! I will never order a delivery, just because I want to come in and have a small talk with the owner and the manager. 

Now, when it comes to pizza,  I will never settle for anything less than Niko`s. I am kind of indecisive when it comes to ordering food, so when they heard what I was trying to order, they made a suggestion to satisfy my cravings.  Pizza with bacon, ricotta and roasted red peppers is a must try! But even if you order just a regular pepperoni it will taste like something you`ve never tried before. 

When you call to order and pick up, they always give you realistic expectations of how long it`s going to take to make the food. They also will give you a call when the pie is in the oven, so you can start heading over for a pick up. So if you are not ready to wait for the best pizza in your life for extra 10-20 minutes, please don`t ruin this amazing pizza parlor for us by posing negative  reviews - it`s hard enough to find decent pizza in Spring Valley, and this place is just 5 minutes from my house."

How does that make sense?? If we drive it home, isn't it the same thing? Just say you Don't want to deliver and then remove that as an option for eat24.

Without any doubt the best pizza I've had in a long, long time (and I don't say that lightly).  Fresh, full of flavor and perfectly prepared.  Niko and his brother provided great service and although very busy took the time to engage me without being over the top.  Speaking with them, I can tell they have a passion for what they do and it shines through in the food they lovingly prepare.  I ordered the Nico's Supreme, take out, which I ordered while driving from Henderson.  They took the care to time it perfectly. They must have checked traffic conditions! Haha! 

Bottom line, we in Vegas have many, many pizza options; I highly recommend giving Nico's a try. It will likely become your favorite neighborhood pie. It has mine. 

Until next time. Ciao!"

Nikos Pizza saved me. The pizza is a thinner crust\/New York style and is delicious.

I order the wings well done and the pepperoni pizza pockets every time... can't go wrong there. Easy 5 stars on taste, customer service and quality ingredients. 

Nikos Wings, puts Buffalo Wild Wings to shame... do yourself a favor and order nikos wings"

I would have been fine with a discount. I would come back because they made an effort to make the 2 hour wait time for us right by not charging us for the meal. After finally taking our food home to 4 hungry kids and a toddler we all thought the pizza was very good by far one of the best pizza I have ever had. I will be going back for the delicious pizza but mainly because they made an effort to make up for the 2 hour wait time. Owner said they had many orders and only two of them working. Next time I call in to eat I will make sure their not too busy and they have enough employees to work for the day. 

Horrible!!!! I called for pick up one extra large specialty pizza and one large cheese pizza with an order of wings. The guy told me he has two orders ahead of me and said it would take 45 minutes. I said that's fine I don't mind waiting 45 minutes.....I called at 553 arrived to pick up at 645 so i arrived over the 45 minute time frame only to be told that it's not ready he needs another 20 minutes. 20 minutes? I shave to wait for my order for over an hour is just insane it's not delivery it's pick up. If it was delivered I could understand the long wait time it was absolutely ridiculous."

However, after experiencing one of the best pizza's in Las Vegas, I just had to leave my personal thoughts. Mind you, to say I'm passionate for pizza would be an understatement. I prefer head over heels for pizza. Any who, on to my review. If I had to use only one word to describe my dinning experience, it would only be 'DECADENCE."" Yes, Niko's Pizza is pure savory decadence. I have had the luxury to spend many summers in Italy, and with that being said I have high expectations for my taste in Pizza. This by far is the only Pizzeria that comes close to giving you the true intoxicating taste of Europe. Each bite is full with an abundance of invigorating delightfulness. The cheese used, is bursting with flavor. The olives are completely delicious an leave the most wonderful aroma that will have you feeling like Zeus and Aphrodite themselves. The tomato sauce, well, that just leaves me absolutely speechless. So delicious, it's unbelievable. I'm completely in love with this place and it's heartwarming ambiance. The staff is also very welcoming, friendly, and helpful. It truly is a family owned and oriented restaurant. Which is quite evident with the uplifting customer service. I highly recommend this place to anybody who truly loves Pizza.  As the Italians would say "" Uno non può pensare bene, amare bene, dormire bene, se non ha mangiato bene."" Meaning, one cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one hasn't eaten well. So trust me, you will definitely be eating well here. Bon Appetite!"

Niko came out and greeted me which was really nice.  He offered me a sample of his BLT pizza while I waited.  It was so unbelievably fresh.  They put the lettuce on after the pizza is baked and the mayo dressing was so light is was a wonderful compliment to the pizza.

This review is long overdue, I am a pizza snob, and the first time I had a slice of this stuff I knew it was the real deal. These brothers are artists, and pretty cool dudes too. I order something different every time and it's always a masterpiece. I think my favorite is the Vesuvio.. but Niko puts so much pride into every pie that it's hard to pick a favorite. It's a rare privilege for an Italian girl to find pizza this great in Summerlin, and I as much as I'd like to keep this discovery a secret (because they surely appreciate and take great care of their customers) - I hope they get all the overwhelming business they deserve!

The other ones I go to are near the strip and get crowded with tourist pretty fast. I came by the other day during their happy hour (5-8pm) to check it out. It's very nice inside but it is a little small. They have a relaxed atmosphere and I like that they play music videos on multiple tv screens. 

The hookah was only $10 and one of the servers suggested blue mist mixed with orange and I really liked it. The food and drinks were mediocre.... I ordered 2 margaritas and didn't even have a buzz after. My friend ordered Hennessy & Sprite and it was also watered down. I tried the mini tacos that were $2 each, one steak & one chicken and they were both bland. 

The customer service was really good and everyone was friendly. I might stop by in another month or so to see if the food and drinks have improved."

The intimacy of the place is chill since they are working with such a small space. Happy hour was from 6pm-8pm so tacos weren't $2 but being taco Tuesday they should've at least had some sort of special with tacos. 
I was hungry so they accommodated me for tacos to be vegetarian which my friend made fun of me because when it came out it reminded him of rabbit food. Corn tortilla, lettuce with bell peppers and a side of not much pico, with sriracha. I noticed other pictures of chips coming with the tacos from previous reviews and I had no chips at all. 
I had some diva mule drink but drinking from a straw was hard due to the fruit garnish getting stuck from the bottom so just ditch the straw. Hookah was great forgot the flavor since our server recommended it but two coals should be good at first since not even 10 minutes into our bowl the harshness was real.
I had a problem with the way this place was suppose to be unwinding and chill but this group in the corner was going at it very obnoxiously wanting to fight and the staff tried to take care of it so I had to listen to two gentlemen wanting to fight each other by not taking it outside for at least 20 minutes.

My most recent order, however, has been a complete nightmare. At 8:15 AM, there was no sign of my delivery, nor was there at 10:15, or at noon. I saw a couple of boxes on my neighbors porch, but I'm not through type and I don't go through other peoples mail. It turns out I should have. Mina finally got back to me, and said that the delivery driver told her that the packages have been delivered. I replied back, that there was nothing on my front porch and that had been home since 6 AM to see nothing delivered eight hours later. She then replied to me and said that her delivery driver returned and confirmed that the boxes were there, this time with a picture. By no coincidence, there was some shuffling outside of my door about five minutes prior but unfortunately I was in the bathroom and couldn't catch the delivery driver in the act. I attempted to call no less than two dozen times, but the number is automated and no one ever actually picks up. So I drove to the address listed on Google and on their website, only to find out that they haven't been there for sometime.

I ordered the cake on Thursday to pick up on Saturday for the birthday dinner. I really didn't know what to expect since I've never ordered a vegan cake before. I was just hoping it wouldn't be dry and it wouldn't be obviously vegan since everyone else in my family eats animal products.

I picked up the cake at 6pm on Saturday and I was so happy with the way it looked. The design exceeded my expectations. It was all blue with polka dots and a dinosaur train toy on top. I didn't think they'd be able to put a toy on it and decorate it that way with such short notice. I was just expecting something basic and they gave me an amazing design for my son's bday.

As far as the taste, it was AMAZING. Everyone loved the cake. No one could believe it was vegan. It was so moist and delicious. My aunt kept saying, ""wow, they used real strawberries for the cream and filling too."" It was a hit and I'm so happy I ordered my cake from Lidet.

My friend invited to for lunch, and she got two pulpo tacos and one fish. I got one pulpo, one fish, and one shrimp. I should have just gotten all three pulpo. The fish and shrimp was good, but not mind blowingly better than other places I've had. But the octopus! Not only have I not seen it on menus as a hot dish or taco, but it was also prepared so well, with a crispy, yet not hard shell tortilla, and fresh cabbage\/tomato\/chipotle cream. Everything about it was perfect.

The chef\/owner? was extremely nice and remembered my friend. She spilled some sauce on her white pants and asked for some soda water to try to clean it up. He didn't have any, so he went to the Super Burrito place across the lot and got some for her there. What service!

The only thing is it's a little pricey, but it is in the normal part of downtown and not the ghetto. It's across from Viva Las Arepas. Parking is easy, and more parking in the back as well.

There is a small parking lot right in front of Bajamar off Las Vegas Blvd. It can be a bit tight, and a few transients have been sighted, but it makes for a great show when you're having lunch or dinner.

I was walked through the menu, which is in English on one side - Spanish on the other, and wanted to try everything. The service was top-notch. Very attentive and I could tell that he sincerely wanted me to have a great experience. I went with the Bajamar Fish Taco and Lucas Taco. Pause here as I take a moment of silence for these tacos.

The Bajamar taco was fresh, battered just enough, and packed with flavor. The Lucas Taco blew my mind.

They make their own horchata and it was amazing. I'm not an expert, but it was creamy, not too sweet. I loved it. 

I took a chance and ordered the cheesecake to go. This was more of a 3-star cheesecake and wasn't decorated with fruit or any type of sauce like I was expecting based on other photos. I had one bite at home, tossed the rest. I might give it one more chance during my next trip, but only because I love cheesecake so much. It will be better for my belly if I don't like it anyway. Plus, more room for Lucas Tacos!!!"

Besides going to San Diego or Mexico, good fish tacos are hard to find. This place does not disappoint. 

This spot used to be a bizarre Chinese food\/donuts place. I know, weird. So when I saw this was being remodeled, I was hoping it would turn into something decent. I was wary to try at first, but after some friends recommended I had to try. I'm glad I did. I didn't try a thing that I didn't like. And the hibiscus lemonade is delicious. I'll be sure to try the horchata next time. 

The decor in here is nice. The spot is small but packs a mighty punch. This needs to be in your taco rotation. And the prices are excellent. Don't be afraid of the parking lot, eat the tacos!"

With the recommendation from my coworker, I decided to stop in and see what he was ""taco""ing about. :)

We both had a specialty drink, a shrimp tostada as well as two tacos each and we split the last one. For under I believe 30? Which is steal for the quality of food and detail they put out of that kitchen! Considering they are on LV blvd you should not complain about the prices. especially with how BIG the tacos are and the generous amount of fish given.

Manny is I believe the owner\/general manager, but he was also our server! He was pleasant and always had a smile, and welcoming guests everytime they walked in. A couple who would be considered a ""regular"" who has visited the past couple of days while on vacation... walked in and he greeted them and seem to know what they were gonna order before they order it! How sweet! Manny and my boyfriend got to talking about various things, and how they started and where they are from. He is just an overall wonderful person to talk with. He even walked food over to there rival super burrito... EVEN THEY liked his food! :) 

Boyfriend loved the authenticity of the horchata, the sauces, the fish batter, and the tostada. I loved it all. :)

I will be def coming back, and I will continue to tell people about this spot. They have only been open 4 months, and I hope they are there for the next forty years. 

Come try them out, give a small business a chance to grow, they are hard working just trying to bring good food to vegas!"

Grab a trio of tacos or a couple of tostadas and share with a friend- or don't, I won't judge you.

When we first walked in it was very quite only one other couple in the place. Didn't see any staff right away. Took a couple of minutes before we got greeted. But once we did, very nice. The overall atmosphere was a little dark, but very festive. Both Mexican style and Halloween. 

They brought chips and salsa and a veggie soup. The chips are very fresh, tasted made that day. So tasty too. We both ordered different things, he ordered a carnitas burrito with rice. I ordered the too hard chicken taco plate with rice and beans ($10.50). Not bad prices. Was very pleased with the portion sizes.  The food was quickly brought out and very fresh and we'll made.

Recently opened at 5795 West Tropicana Avenue, the former location of an Indian Restaurant that has been lightened up and rebranded with a Mexican Menu, it was with friends that dinner was enjoyed on Saturday at Chupy's Mexican Restaurant, the sizable space yet to catch on but likely only due to a lack of advertising as the flavors tend quite authentic with good prices for this style of Cuisine on the West Side.

Owned by a husband and wife couple out of California, the Chef formerly splitting time between four locations on the West Coast before moving his family to Las Vegas, it was just past 7pm that the party of four sat down at a table near the bar where Agua Fresca's are currently made and kept alongside soda, a liquor license yet to arrive but reportedly on the way though apparently tied up by Sin City's lengthy wait list.

Redecorated with backlit Mariachis, character painted walls and old photos of Mexico, the overhead music appropriate and not overly loud with a festive feel, it was shortly after seats were taken that both the restaurant Manager and Chef stopped by to offer their greetings, a laminated menu displaying several plates visually with several dozen choices including choices as traditional as Aguachile and Molcajete all the way to Nachos, Tacos and Fajitas.

Carefully balancing authenticity with broad appeal, the fact that everything save for Desserts are made in house daily speaking of ownership not looking to cut corners in winning over a crowd, it was prior to orders being placed that a large basket of Housemade Tortilla Chips were presented warm alongside Salsa with a medium amount of heat, the quality of both impressive compared to most Off-Strip spots while a complimentary Quesadilla Appetizer was pretty standard stuff, though the toasty Flour Tortilla was quite fluffy despite being pan-seared around Cheese.

Not dissuaded by the lack of Margaritas, though certainly many do come to a Mexican Restaurant with expectations of such, it was instead with Water and two Agua Frescas that the Meal was enjoyed, the uncarbonated Hibiscus Flower version mild like herbal Tea while the pale Tamarind drink was fruity and refreshing between bites including a starting duo of Shrimp and Scallops served in white-hot porcelain with Cheese, Peppers and Onions served alongside the equally sizzling Molcajete filled with a Tomato-based Sauce heavy with Chiles as well as Garlic below a rim ringed in Beef, Shimp, Chicken, Cactus and Cheese.

Serving well-seasoned Mexican Rice and scratch-made Refried Beans with most plates, the latter showing a lot of care in terms of texture and flavor with great smoothness and just a touch of Cumin and Salt, it was with the first two plates still being enjoyed that a jumbo Burrito stuffed with Chorizo and all the traditional fixings was served next to Aguachiles so spicy and clean that one may assume that they have crossed the border, the Chef even going so far as to leave the tails on as they do in Mexico City which, although authentic, may come as a surprise to less experienced or unsuspecting diners.

Rounding things out with a Mixed Fajita platter, the choice of housemade Corn or Flour Tortillas a nice touch with everything on the sizzling plate meeting the same high standard as those before it, it was after hearing that Desserts were thus far outsourced that the decision was made to end the meal with a bit more of the Burrito, the smoky Red Sauce having at this point penetrated deeply with both the Rice and Meat inside well saturated and all the better for it. 

***1\/2: Just starting to get up to speed, the failure to secure a liquor license prior to opening and virtually no social media presence to speak of seemingly rookie mistakes for someone with previous Restaurant experience, Chupy's shows a lot of promise for those seeking both Authentic and ""Americanized"" Mexican Food from a kitchen and ownership that so far seems committed to doing things right."

Oh yeah, the food is really solid, too!

Inside, the first impressions are that the owners were in a hurry to get open, regardless of how ""ready"" everything looks. The space was previously occupied by an Indian restaurant that for better or worse, didn't last long. Previous to that was another ethnic restaurant that suffered the same fate. That's the reason why I bring it up: it's a really nice space that actually looks as if it has much more potential than just a hole-in-the-wall place to grab a lunch. I hope the owners continue improving the overall look of the place, as I want this place to stick around a while, especially since it's proven to be a space with a bit of a jinx. 

The food is where things turn everything else on it's head. The chips and salsa are both freshly made, and you can tell. Next, they actually bring you a small bowl of soup (akin to vegetable beef I'd say.) I'll get back to that soup later. 

The main courses I've had have all been really good. There are bright flavors to be had in nearly every bite. The carnitas are pure porky paradise, and aren't the dry mouthful of sand that are often served elsewhere; sad, unfortunate victims of sitting too long. *sniffle* What a waste! Luckily, Chupy's respects the ingredients they use, and serve them up right. The flavor adventure is quite obviously guided by an authentic, experienced hand -- it tastes as if you were invited over to someone's home for a meal. It's then that you forgive the surroundings, because you know you've found something true; something special. In some ways, you almost want it to be your own little secret. Unfortunately, the history of the space won't allow that. 

The first time at Chupy's, a night shortly after they opened, was funny. It took around ten minutes to be noticed for seating, despite there only being one other party in the entire dining room. The previously mentioned soup had stars for noodles. There was a bar with no alcohol. Now, the soup is served as if it's actually meant for adults. Service is quick, and personable. They serve alcohol. The food remains as good as always. Chupy's continues to make changes as it gains it's sea legs in a tough location. If you're a fan of great Mexican food served with care and attention, I implore you to do your part to help a family owned local business stay open. The proof is in the food, and Chupy's definitely delivers."

They have all your favorites here, starting off with an excellent chip & salsa, fresh camaron ceviche tostada with a punch of citrus and delicate shrimp, and all your taco\/burrito\/enchilada needs.

The standout winner here by far was the Tampiquena Steak ($16.95). Delicious! Cooked medium, very juicy and flavorful with all the sauteed veggies. Highly recommended!  I sliced mine up, put it on piping hot tortillas with a splash of cheesy beans, flavorful rice and a dab of house made chunky guacamole....my mouth waters in delight!

Another solid choice was the A La Diabla \/ Devil Shrimp ($17.99). Smokey Chipotle flavors, not much heat. The sauce is reminiscent of a great BBQ marinade surrounding nice sized prawns :)

The food was unbelievably good! We had chicken breast, teriyaki pork ribs, grilled mixed veggies, chicken and veggie noodle dish, sticky rice and Hawaiian rolls.

Everyone was very pleased with the menu and the flavor and tenderness of the meats. Poppa Naps BBQ did not disappoint at all, there was plenty of food and I even had some to take home. I had several guests staying at the house and having the left overs was helpful. All my guests told me how much they enjoyed the food. How good it was and were asking me where I found them.

They are utterly amazing. When our wedding planning start in April 2016 we were having a tough time deciding who to get as a caterer and one that would actually come out to our venue in Indian Springs. I was first confused on how we would ever get a taste test of Poppa Naps, but after sending an email through their website Napoleon contacted me right away and offered several different times (when he'd be doing other events) for us to come taste his food. 

We ended up tasting the food during the summer at an event that was being held around the Smith Center area. We tried the pulled pork and chicken and were totally sold. I knew this is who we were going to get to cater our wedding. It took me awhile to get back around to contacting Napoleon and we were afraid he would be unavailable. Nevertheless him and his crew were available to cater our wedding. After much discussion we went with huli huli chicken, brisket, pulled pork, pancit, mac and cheese, as well as beans. He was very agreeable and easy to coordinate with when our headcount kept fluctuating.

Our wedding was October 28, 2017 at Indian Springs Ranch and Poppa Naps definitely helped make it a night to remember. After taking some photos he called us over for some prime time first sampling and boy was it delicious! Our wedding guests loved the food and so did we! 

At the end of the night Napoleon and his crew wrapped up what was left and our family got to enjoy his food for the next couple of days.

We definitely wish we could have more of Poppa Naps food and would definitely recommend them if you want some fresh, onsite, and delicious barbeque!"

Which wad yet another reason I was apprehensive on having the event catered. But then Poppa Nap came and mad some amazing BBQ that left the party speechless! Napoleon adapted to the party so well, he didn't judge anyone and had a great time with us. He served great smoked food right on time and constantly refilled empty trays (food was kept warm in the smoker)! He even threw some hot dogs on the grill for me for the kids! I wish I had pics of the food, but everyone devoured it even packed plates before the party was over!
He provided everything! His own table, napkins forks, Bbq sauce- if you look into other places they charge for those things and other places even charge to bring the smoker out- NOT Poppa Nap the quality of food and price CAN'T be beat!

Ribs- were cooked perfect the ratio of meat and fat was great with seasoning that was out of this world- making no need for BBQ sauce (although I heard the the sauce was great too)

Brisket- is a must! That was a big hit. It was so juicy and flavorful!

The food...  Oh my gosh, being from Texas I have very particular ideas in mind for my bbq, especially the brisket.  The brisket was smokey, tender and juicy and he had removed the fatty parts as he sliced.  The chicken was smokey and unbelievably succulent, that's the only word we could think of to describe it.  The ribs were delicious and tender.
For the fixings, we got macaroni and cheese, potato salad and cole slaw, which were all very good.
Everyone at our party was carrying on about how delicious the food was.  And there were times while we were eating that there was not a single word being spoken out of our group of 20 people, which is highly unusual.

I am so glad I found Maximina and The Heavenly Vegan. I was on a long search to find a meatless meal prep option and thankfully I found The Heavenly Vegan. Maximina provides you with delicious, healthy, vegan meals, and you can tell her food really comes from her heart! There are so many things to rave about, but the top three things that stand out for me is the quality, portion size, and convenience.

The quality of food that Maximina provides is spectacular! I feel at ease knowing that she cooks with non-GMO and organic ingredients. When I was looking at other meal prep companies, it did not seem to be a top priority for them. Many other companies did not offer meatless options either. One company even admitted they only use about 20% of organic and\/or non-GMO ingredients... Yikes! I like to be knowledgable about the food that goes into my body, and The Heavenly Vegan takes away any doubt I have about good and healthy plant-based food. Also, you can really taste the freshness in the food. I love seeing how Maximina incorporates so many different colored vegetables into her recipes. Her food is not only delicious, but it is a sight to see!

When ordering from The Heavenly Vegan, I was worried that I might feel hungry after eating the meals. Boy, was I wrong! The portions that Maximina provide are HUGE! I feel full after each meal, and sometimes I even had to split one meal into two. I feel that her meals are really worth every buck.

Lastly, I have never tasted such great vegan food that was so convenient! Sometimes I don't have time to cook because of work, but the meals from The Heavenly Vegan take away that stress for me. The meals are well packaged, easy to heat up, and some I even ate cold! This vegan food is very delicious and it is even better than some vegan sit-down restaurants I've been to. I can comfortably eat at home, not waste time in a restaurant setting, and still get yummy, fresh food.

Open extremely late and a perfect post clubbing destination.  We came to try some food and drink as we were craving Korean wings and chicken.  Food was pretty good drunk food but not quality by any means.  Nice spiciness that wasn't too overpowering. The garlic wings were dry but true to their name.  But for about $10-12, it's very tasty.  J karaoke is known as the best karaoke in town so I'll rent a room and experience the true story of J one of these days."

The room was decorated so cute. Two tv's in the room. A laser light machine. There was also a Beatles decal on the wall. I loved it right away. I liked that it was a dining table instead of a coffee table. It was easier to access the food. 

We ordered food and soju. Everything came out fast and hot. The wings were surprisingly delicious. Big wings, crispy, and perfectly sauced. I will be back for the wings. We have a couple different types of fries and nachos at the table. All were delicious.

I experienced the worst costumer service in my life here! Tikis kitchen is closed so we went to J's for food I ordered one beer and 20 piece buffalo wings, when i started eating the wings they were extremely hot my mouth was burning and nose started to run so I tried to get the rest of the table to eat them but they were way too hot even for them! So I called over waiter and just asked if I can switch out the set of 10 wings we didn't touch into something less hot, the manager comes over and tells us no because they are regular buffalo wings ha No they weren't I love buffalo just had some at peppermill the night before and they didn't burn my mouth and make nose runny! We weren't asking for refund just simply asking for something we can enjoy eating without burning up! So the conclusion was that he wouldn't do it I had to pay for a 20 piece wing I couldn't even eat I seriously only ate 1 wing and the 2 other people with me couldn't even finish 1 themselves!

We were offered the menu which had a huge selection of snacks. We ordered the fries and sweet potato fries here! Our server was on top of our service with drinks, orders, cups and more. 

The room we had was very spacious. We were offered multiple joiners of juices and fruits and I love the offer for healthier options. They also kept up with keeping our rooms clean which we appreciated.

My sister recommended this place based on the yelp reviews. We have never gone to a karaoke bar in Vegas but we were trying to be adventurous. 

The first time we came here we were unable to get a room, I forget if it was because our sister was underage at the time. Nevertheless, we were hungry and decided to eat dinner here. We ordered the Specialty french fries, chicken wings (soy garlic and korean spicy sweet), spicy rice cake, and mild ramen with egg. THE FOOD IS AMAZING. My favorite is the specialty french fries although I wish they had 2 eggs instead of one and the soy garlic chicken wings. My siblings were pleased by the food, nothing was bland or dry. 

The second time we came here, we were able to get a karaoke room and soju! The lychee soju was great. I love the karaoke rooms, probably the best I have been to so far. They have so many songs to choose from (english, korean, japanese, filipino) and you can adjust the settings. The karaoke system here had the best sounds. They even have tambourines in the room that people can play while singing. 

I don't think 4 hours of singing was enough for the 4 of us. Wish we could've stayed longer. Will come again if I am in a singing mood or just want to eat good pupus."

We had kept the birthday boy with us while eating dinner while the rest of the party got essentially the largest room this place has to offer (Room M - located in the far back of the venue, the last room to the left). Since we were rushing in for a surprise, we didn't look at the beginning at the venue and went to the room. 

Located next to Marugame Monzo, it is along with other places in one of the hardest strip malls to park at. Most of us has had multiple experiences in the difficulty of parking in this strip mall. Theres so much this strip mall offers, and not enough parking. There's tons more parking located 2 building back but theres no easy way to access it. 

Room M is the largest room they have to offer (I believe). It has 3 long tables lining the sides of the room with a large TV in the front and smaller TV to the rear. This room can easily fit 20 people with probably room to spare. Theres enough room that even with the seats filled, the center of the room Is still empty for uh ... ""entertainment"" XD This room prices at I believe $60\/hour, which isn't bad if you have enough people to split but the drinks stack up. Between a few of us, we had gotten a bucket of Cass (6 bottles) and a large bottle of Lychee Soju. Seats were fairly clean but the tables would do a better cleaning. We were given complimentary French fries to each table in the room. What was surprising was the microphones are both wireless. Never had seen that in karaoke places here. And each microphone has a replaceable cover over it too. 

We had paid separately. Due to possibly the size of the room or maybe the number of people, they had placed an automatic 18% gratuity, plus the bucket and soju totaling into mid 30s, which resulted in the bill getting to mid 40s after the gratuity. 

Not much of a fan of kararoke esp since majority of the songs I listen to aren't usually available nor am I much of a singer.. Quite the shy type XD"

The drinks are cheap, especially when you compare it to drinks on the strip. You can get a bottle of Soju for ONLY $9! They have a special that goes on, on Sundays and Mondays where you can get a shot of Jameson AND any bottle of beer for $8. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that.

I live relatively far from downtown, but I was in the area and was so excited to finally have an excuse to try it. Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by the staff and they gave me recommendations of what to try and even suggested that I check out IG if I was just going by what looked pretty (which was funny). The menu had a variety of options many of which were nutrient dense and vegan such as the smoothies, bowls, and mermaid\/unicorn\/rainbow toasts; indulgent options included things like paninis and grilled cheese. I decided on the $10 fairy tale bowl which was reminiscent of the typical acai\/pitaya bowls that we know too well, however the star ingredient is a type of highly nutrient algae called blue magic. The owner made sure to make it look as ""instagrammable"" as possible, which I highly appreciated! Taste-wise, this tasted as delicious as it looked and to be honest I liked it better than some acai bowls I've had in the past. What was interesting about this place was that it was small...veeeery small, like, the size of a closet. I had no issue with this but perhaps there would be some people that would want to sit and enjoy their food with friends.

Replacing Grassroots with the same blue print sounds like a good idea, but you need to match their standards or raise the bar higher. 

I ordered the first smoothie from the menu the Power Up. Kale, spinach, banana, mango, and water. I'm trying to find a word to describe it and I'm actually shrugging my shoulders in the ""meh"" sense. It was just that. Not terrible, but it didn't leave a lasting impression either. I think of the great smoothies that I have had in the past, and notice that they have a handful or more of ingredients and usually have more texture to them. The smoothie was only $5 WITH tax, but I wouldn't mind paying $7-8 if the smoothie had oatmeal, flaxseed, cocoa nibs, dates, avocado, or something a little more substantial that might cost a little more to produce.  

I'll definitely be back again in a few months to try another smoothie, and see where they're at!"

If you know donut bar you will find this place. My friend told me about this place on yelp so I checked it out. I saw they had dole whip so I got more than excited because they were advertising it. I walked a while to go get some. I got there and they didn't have the stuff to make it. HUGEEEEEE bummer because I Walked all that way for it. I'm not upset because I ended up getting something  else but others aren't like that and might have been pissed that had advertisement up for something they didn't have yet. I'm understanding because I'm in the business but some others won't be as happy.

They said they would have it soon so I'm hoping that's true. I would say this place is in a good location being where they are. I do hope they succeed because we need a healthy alternative down there. 


I ended up getting a smoothie bowl that was incredible. It has hemp seeds, granola, blueberries and DRAGON FRUITTTTT!!!!  The dragon fruit was amazing it tasted like a subtle kiwi. If this place continues I hope they bring in more different exotic fruit because that would sure separate them from others. Especially with the farmers market so close. 

Besides the dole whip I only suggest two things as a new business, have different size bowls because I can eat a lot more and like options. Also add some more Berries on it because a lot of the bowl was just smoothie, needed some MORE to go in it to be considered hearty.


Thank you guys for your awesome customer service and great bowls. I will be back and on the look out for dole whip ;p"

The first time, I ordered the ProGreen smoothie & an açaí bowl. The cashier (which I later discovered is also the owner) responded to my order with, ""Are you sure you don't want the blue bowl?"" while pointing to a photo of it. I should have taken this to be a sign that their açaí would not be so great but I love açaí bowls and ALWAYS try them when they are on a menu. The green smoothie was good. It tasted just as expected. The açaí bowl came out watery and immersed with sesame seeds. I find it a bit odd to have sesame seeds in an açaí bowl but was willing to try it...ehh, it's definitely not appealing to my taste buds. 

The second time, my boyfriend and I were in the area, and I decided to give their IG popular items a try. I ordered their fairy tale bowl and the mermaid toast. The toast just tasted like toast with vegan cream cheese on it. It wasn't something I would order again; however, their fairy tail bowl did live up to expectations! This bowl's presentation is very BLUEtiful. The blue green algae taste is well hidden by the blended fruits. I tasted prominently green grapes...not sure exactly what the blend was.

I have been here several times and each time I'm impressed. To say its an upgrade to Downtown is an understatement. 

I'm not familiar with their whole menu because we get the same things every time.

My SO gets the green one because his favorite fruit is mango. I need to steal a sip next time because I have never tried it. He usually slurps it right down. Yum. 

I always get the Beet Box because...well BEETS!!!! Its not too earthy and its not sweet. Just the way I like it. 

I somehow time it perfectly and get to grab a ""few minutes fresh"" wheatgrass shots. Always yum. 
Their ginger cayenne shot is good but it will put hair on your chest for sure. 

They have Dole Whip now. Yesterday when I was there the owner gave me a sample...lets just say it was sooooo good I wanted to order a huge bathtub of it. He said a large portion is $6, seems like a great deal!

The owners (gentleman & wife) are super duper sweet and their business partners own Donut Bar.

Smooth Eats stepped into a former juice bar but added friendly service and a limited but well-executed menu. It's definitely an upgrade in my book.

The smoothies are all $5 and you can add on extra ingredients like flax seed, protein, etc. but I stick to the basics. The Beetbox and ProGreens are solid smoothies... actually, they're liquid, like they're supposed to be, but the flavors aren't overwhelmingly earthy, bitter, or sweet, which seems to happen when I take a chance on chain smoothies. 

They have paninis, toasts, and acai bowls for those wanting something more substantial. So far, I've only tried the SD Toast (sundried tomato pesto, avocado, cilantro, sea salt) but I was impressed. I plan to try their strawberry version on my next visit!

TIP: If you're driving, this grab and go business is in a paid parking area. Short of them getting a dedicated parking space out front, your best bet is to pull into the lot around back and be quick."

The guy that works here is very friendly and upbeat. His wife and him run the place, or so it sounded like.

The place is brand spankin new and is making a big slash with the food scene. I came down for their not so secret, secret menu item the ""Mermaid toast"" man not only does it looks good it taste even better. 

I also got the apple cider vinegar shot with heathy blue stuff and it was mixed with their very own filtered water. Best apple cider shot I've taken. Followed that up with their ginger shot and man oh man did I felt so good. 

My girls loved their Dole whip which was of coarse refreshing and delicious and I can't wait to come back and try their avocado toasts and of coarse the mermaid bowl.

The best part of all this yummy eats is that it's all super healthy for you. Chad really took the time to explain all the ingredients and their health benefits and his conviction and pride for his food really shows through the knowledge and passion he has for the products he serves up and for me that gets a 2 thumbs up and a 5 star for sure.

I'm also a sucker for a panini. Smooth Eats is a juice bar, smoothie, shop, and quick bite type of spot down town. They don't have any seating but have areas to eat that they share with the neighboring businesses. It's more of a grab and go place.
I tried two of their paninis- one had a sun dried tomato pesto with turkey and the other had basil pesto with Italian meats. The sandwich was a good size and the flavors were great. They have very fresh ingredients. I also tried their piña colada and a couple of their juice shots which were amazing! The lemon cayenne one is nuts. 

The prices for everything were pretty average to high in my opinion. You get what you pay for and healthier foods are a bit more. Definitely doesn't break the bank and definitely worth the cost.

My last two cents for not giving them five stars was I felt the panini wasn't cooked long enough. The cheese was barely melting and the very center of the sandwiches were colder. Just a couple minutes more maybe? 

They care pineapple dole whip though and it's amazing.

The staff is super nice and helpful and I'd definitely recommend this place."

We tried both the grilled cheese and the italian panini. 

If you're looking for that perfect Instagram cheese pull, this is your sandwich. The cheese just oozes out. It's a really good grilled cheese. I wish they had one cheese in there that's a bit sharper (like a sharp cheddar), so the flavor of the cheese still comes through when melted. 

The italian was super flavorful. I loved the pepperoni and the pesto. This is an EXTREMELY oily sandwich, though. Be prepared for all the grease. You're going to need napkins.

Smooth Eats is TINY, so I would recommend you eat on the go. Otherwise, you'll have to try and score the one table.

Admittedly, I'm not such a health food nut as he is, but I love me some smoothies. 

We were originally attracted to their claim on Dole Whip, but their machine hadn't been delivered yet, so we were mildly disappointed. Af first. Their menu is still evolving, and they have a few ""off menu"" smoothie bowls that caught our attention. 

I had the acai bowl, topped with chia seeds, granola, and blackberries. It was delicious, and the bowl was a decent size. It could have used some more blackberries, simply because they are one of my all time favorite berries!

The owners, I presume, were very, very courteous and helpful. We enjoyed their service immensely. They even offered to try to fake he Dole Whip, without the soft serve machine, but we declined so they didn't have to go through extra effort for something they don't even serve yet.

One look at the menu and you know right away this isn't your typical tacos, burritos, enchiladas Mexican place (don't get me wrong, they have those too but be brave, try something new). 

Your first hint of the goodness to come is the pre-meal chips and salsa that arrives with a flight of three different salsas. The red one that's oil, garlic and chili is excellent.  I had the Pollo Sarandead. It's chicken stuffed with chorizo on a bed of Spanish rice and an amazing sauce that starts out mild and gives a bit of a kick at the end.  Old family recipe and I can see why. I've never had anything like this in Vegas. Superb! 

This will definitely be my go-to Mexican place on the West Side. Kudos to the chef for the inventive menu and excellent fresh food!!!"

I also ordered the tuna carpaccio and the guac roasted garlic and crab.  Both of those dishes were really good except the tuna carpaccio is more on the smaller side and not really an entree portion.


They give you complimentary chips and salsa and the Macho sauce (the darkest one) is the best.  It has a smiley flavor and made out of helio peppers.

For my drink I got the watermelon ginger margarita, I love watermelon & ginger beer so the excitement was real when I saw this on the menu.

Last but not least, what's a good new restaurant without amazing service?!  Everyone was friendly and the owner came up to us and ask for feedback.  I'm probably going to be coming here often since my boyfriend is now in love with their pork belly tacos :D"

The pre-meal chips and salsa are delicious, each of the 3 salsas have true authentic mexican flavors. My only complaint would be to make the chips a little bigger, it was hard to scoop all the salsa-y goodness onto the very small chips they provide.

Guacamole portion is huge and super yummy, nice to see they aren't skimpy on the avocados. Chipotle should take some notes....

I've ordered the tacos al pastor twice now and each time they have not disappointed, pork isn't fatty and pineapple is perfectly grilled.  My boo thangggg ordered the chicken fajitas and they were fantastic! Both entrees were accompanied by mexican rice and refried beans.

Service: The staff was very friendly and efficient. Polite and helpful! The hostess was peppy and cracked a lot of corny jokes. I'm a sucker for corny jokes. Our server was very nice and our water and chips and salads were filled to the brim at all times. 

Food: it was delicious! I ordered their Chipotle Mushroom Chimichanga, and my friend got the Carne Asada Fries and Lamb Chimichanga. The flavors were very unique and it exploded in my mouth. *wink* They had this chili garlic oil sauce for the chips that made me drooool. You guys should try it. 

Venue Ambience: it wasn't your typical mariachi band Mexican Spanish radio music playing in the background, it's actual hipster-top 40 hispanish American music. Very loungey. The internal design of the place was very gastro pub-ish retro\/hipster thing.

The guac didn't have much taste,  I prefer more salt  (which was not at the table) and more lime and cilantro. 
The three salsa tastings at the beginning were all very good.  Try them all!
I got carne asada tacos.  The only thing I'd say is I didn't care for the heavy season on the beef. I'd rather the meat just have a simple flavor.  It made it seem more like the taco seasoning you use when making tacos at home.

The Shrimp Sope is a grand slam. My favorite thing on the menu period.

I love the bar area and the dining area had a nice atmosphere and a cool mural. My bf and I had our choice of tables and sat the booth. 

We saw a few dishes we like on the bar and drink menu so we tried to order, the  waitress said only available at the bar. We wondered why were we given that menu. We requested her to make an exception so she went and ask her manager. They were were kind enough to let us order from bar menu.

The complimentary chips and salsa with 3 salsas came to the table. The chips were crunchy and not oily and my fave sauce was Macho.

We ordered the Octopus Salteado, came out very fresh, and the sauces on it were flavorful. That was our favorite dish.

Chicken wings was ok and Pork Belly slider needs some sauce on it, it was not pork belly and was bland. 

Churro waffle with icecream dessert was huge and sweet..I was sugar high!

I ordered a campechana ceviche to start, duck carnitas for my entrée, and flan for dessert.  The campechana consisted of shrimp, mussels, octopus, crab, and avocado with an ancho chipotle sauce.  It was outstanding.  A good amount of seafood with a spicy sauce to work with the citrus.

The duck carnitas were good but the duck was a bit dry.  Having three kinds of salsa helped.  The dish was something quite different for a Mexican restaurant.

Dessert of orange flavored flan was another outstanding dish.  The beginning and end of the meal were the best parts.

My server was Ashley and she was very helpful with questions I had and with always keeping my iced tea filled.

The seating is well spaced out so there is plenty of room to move around.  I was there with a party of three for lunchtime.  The staff was courteous and efficient.  My friends ordered a watermelon margherita and finished it to the last drop!  Chips and a flight of three different salsas were brought to the table.  The salsa verde was my favorite.  It tasted even better than typical salsa verde that's served at other Mexican restaurants that I frequent (a secret recipe maybe?!).  I ordered the octopus Salteado appetizer.  It was DELICiOUS!  The best octopus appetizer I've eaten in decades; not exaggerating.  The octopus was cooked perfectly with a sauce that tasted both buttery yet seemed to have mustard seed as an ingredient which gave it a ""fun"" texture.  According to the menu the dish is described 'asromesco lime sauce\/smoked pepper\/creme fraiche'.  Which equates to octopus nirvana for me!  My friend ordered tacos and complimented how good they tasted.  They looked very appealing but my attentions were on eating my octopus.  I also ordered a combination plate that included a cheese chile relleno, beef enchilada, beans & rice.  The enchilada tasted like a unique recipe and quite delicious.  Beans and rice were also very tasty.  The chile relleno was not the typical egg batter variety.  It had a crunchy shell and the cheese used was rather rich tasting.  After a few bites I decided to stop eating it, as the rich flavor was a little too much for my palate.  We were too full for desert.  I will definitely be dining here again, ordering the octopus and then might just go for desert right after that!  Oh the octopus was good!"

My boyfriend and I were greeted warmly and when we were seated, taken care of quickly.

The margarita on the rocks was perfect. I could taste all the flavors without a heavy sour taste, which some margaritas can have. 

I didn't think there would ever come a time when I would rave about chips, but when they're served with a flight of salsa, it's really easy to do. The salsas included green tomatillo, red and a dark oil salsa infused wonderfully with garlic. When you try this salsa, don't forget to scoop up the goodies at the bottom. 

I ordered the Quinoa and Mushroom Chili Relleno. Although this is a vegetarian dish, and I'm not vegetarian, it was just as savory and filling as a non-vegetarian dish. 
My boyfriend opted for the Pollo Sarandeado and couldn't say enough about it (all positive). 

I also had a side salad which was tossed with orange slices and mango which really helped to cool the bit of heat from the relleno. 

For dessert - churro waffles with sliced strawberries, whipped cream and a scoop of ice cream with crispy drizzled chocolate on top. There's only one word I can use to describe the dessert - Divine! 

One of the best Mexican restaurant meals we've had in Las Vegas and I'm we will be back sooner rather than later!"

There is no shortage of Mexican restaurants in this town.  Some are great, some just good. I simply can't understand the rave reviews for this place.

Tonight, a Saturday night at 8:30, we were the only ones in the dining room. The few people at the bar left shortly after we arrived. Throughout our meal, they'd be replaced by others, up to six people at one point. They'd stay a few minutes, then leave. I couldn't see any of them were drinking, but that was definitely weird. They all seemed to be regulars, but not a single one stayed long enough to have a real drink. Down a shot and leave? All of them? Very peculiar.

The complimentary chips seemed to come straight out of a bag, and were salty. Of the three salsas, only the tomato was okay. The dark, middle one was pure oil, and no matter how hard I mixed, it wouldn't combine with the pureed chile at the bottom. The green was the most tasteless ever. 

We didn't find the menu particularly enticing, so I stuck with the tried and true - chicken fajitas. I usually never order that, but my husband, who does, chose a combo chicken enchilada and chile relleno this time. We liked that there was a choice of black or charro beans instead of refritos. He had been about to order a salad with chicken, until we learned that they use iceberg lettuce ONLY. Who does that nowadays?  

Hubby's combo came with a bowl of pozole, and that was very tasty. His enchilada wasn't very big, and the cheese inside the chile relleno wasn't quite melted enough, but his charro beans and rice were fine.

When my dish was served, I could not believe that all the fixin's that go along with fajitas were nowhere in sight. That's no cheese, no pico de gallo, no sour cream, no guacamole. I thought it was overlooked, but noooo, they don't serve it that way. WTF??? The onions and peppers were good, but the chicken was overcooked and so dry it was literally making me choke. And the black beans were undercooked.

The waitress offered to bring me something else, but I had lost my appetite (and no, I didn't OD on those salty chips and my decent margarita). A bit later, the manager, Ashley, came over unbidden and apologetically with guac, sour cream and cheese. She said that Salud is sort of a combo Mexican-Argentine place, so they do things a little differently.  Hey, I've lived in Mexico and have been to Argentina twice, and yes, I know fajitas are really American, but that dry chicken sure needed something. I had a bit more, and Herb, who hates to waste food, polished off the considerable rest of it.

Ashley also presented us with a beautifully-plated dessert - a large dulce de leche flan, that was delicious.

Good service, attentive management, nice ambience. Maybe, just maybe, we didn't order the right things. But all I can do is compare what we had with how other places do the same dishes, and we weren't impressed with the food."

The tacos were soooo good I put some of the garlic oils that came with the chips and salsa on my taco and BAM! Instant yummy! 
The relleno was stuffed with lots of crab and shrimp and was sooo good, but I honestly adored the lobster tacos!

I was excited to see this place was going to open since my family and I love to eat Mexican food.  We were shocked at the prices.  They are very expensive and the food is not gourmet.  Two item combos are $16 and three items are $18. There are only 5 choices on combinations - chile relleno, chicken enchilada, barbacoa enchilada, pork belly tamale and shrimp sope. Three tacos are $14 and burritos are $14. Service was ok, the food didn't have a lot of taste. Soup of the day was $7. The prices are as high or higher than the ""fine"" Mexican restaurants located at the more upscale casinos. I think they will succeed if they drastically lower their prices. It is as if they are trying to do upscale in a strip mall, in an area that has a clientele that consists of mostly local families."

Other tacos not so much. $7 for one shrimp taco or 14 for two, but totally worth it. Loaded with shrimp, perfect sauce-- just amazing!!

This location is horrible in terms of getting to. I'm glad they're moving nearby me on 215 & Rainbow. They should really update their hours and news like people said. Recently drove all they way during lunch at work after looking at their website, got there and said they were closed and moving and this location is being replaced with a different mexican restaurant.

In fact you will probably have a hard time finding it if you are trying to go there. It is in what looks like an old abandoned motel or strip mall. The food lives up to the hype though. I tried all the different tacos and they were great. My wife had the shrimp tacos and she can't stop raving about them. She is already planning on eating there on the next trip to Vegas. That is saying a lot given the number of places you can eat in Vegas with more attractive ambiance. The service was great too.

My spouse found about this place on Yelp. I looked at the menu, saw they have lassi, and our visit was promptly planned. They definitely met our expectations from the reviews.

They are located on the lower level of a two-floor building. If you're coming from the parking lot at the back, you can use one of the stairs-passages, since the entrance is actually on the side.

The owner was friendly and kind. They have daily specials now--go grab your chicken samosas! I had lamb curry, my spouse had chicken curry, and we both had mango lassi. The lassi is wonderful, refreshing and taste-quenching while cutting the spice just right. It had been over five years since I had mango lassi, and Taste's stood up to my memories.

They are very careful to cater to people's spice levels. I like my food mild, and my curry was flavorful with just a hint of spice. The lamb and rice were cooked just right. The owner offered extra chutney to my spouse; about a third was plenty to make lips burn, which is just how my spouse likes their food. The owner even offered us more chutney to go, ifwe would like to bring some home.

There is a wonderful homemade quality to their food. It is really heartwarming to know they are striving to make Desi food available at low prices for UNLV students.

We are definitely coming back to Taste. If you like Indian cuisine or just want to try it, if you're a local or a tourist, seek out this place. You will not regret it!"

You don't have to get toasted to enjoy your meal, but there are multiple dispensaries in the same plaza. Staff are friendly and outgoing, making multiple recommendations and walking visitors through the menu (including sandwich sizes). Surprisingly, they also have an indoor\/outdoor bar featuring unique and local brews. 

Aside from the cannabis-influenced decor and sandwich names, CH is known for their baked goods (get it?): their bread is ""legendary"" and they stock ""munchies"" at the register including rice crispies (in Captain Crunch and Fruity Pebble flavors) and various other sweet, snacky treats. Their garlic herb (heh) bread is pretty solid and pairs well with their Apollo 13 sando, with Greek flavors of grilled chicken, spring mix, salad dressing, cucumbers, tomato, red onion, and feta. I'd add some other melty cheese to this in the future. For bonus points, they have several vegetarian sandwiches!

I'm not the hugest fan of their open-face serving, the sandwiches seem to have less toppings than other places, but the prices are fair for the portion."

I got the Kali Mist which is a California turkey club and I go it with a garlic toasted roll. So damn good! 
I was very pleased with it not only in flavor but if these guys consistently have fresh delicious rolls like I had tonight, I will keep coming back. 

Only thing I will say, as a personal preference that is, the cheese tasted excellent but it was a little much cheese for me and that doesn't say much. I don't like as much cheese as most people do so take that with a grain of salt. I think most people who love California clubs would absolutely love this with the garlic toasted roll I got. 
So go here toasty or sober as a bird! You'll love it either way if every night is like my experience this evening.

How much can they vary? Bread, check. Stuff that goes on bread, check. Drinks to go with the sandwiches, check. 

Fine. But these sandwiches are REALLY good, okay? ""Counter-culture"" affiliation aside, these people make some really damn good food in this shop. I had the Kali Mist which is their version of the Club and the first thing I thought was, ""RIP lipstick"" when they brought it out. Just the right amount of turkey (I really hate when there's too much turkey on a sandwich. It's a thing) and chipotle mayo. The only thing I would have changed is the bacon to a thick cut but that's being nitpicky.

My husband, the vegetarian, had the Humboldt and it seemed like I blinked and he finished it. Safe to say he enjoyed it as well. Oh, and we started with the pretzels and honey mustard, at the recommendation of the super nice guy who took our order. I would go back just for those. 

Let's talk about the iced tea. I'm really picky about my iced tea. Ignore the plain one and go straight to the flavored one. You don't even need to add a lot of sugar to it. I would also go back just for the tea, if we're being honest here. And why wouldn't I be?

I have tried many subs including the: Acapulco Gold, White Widow, G-13 and the 5-0. All of them were excellent but out of all of them, I suggest getting the G-13 as the chipotle mayo in that sandwich off the chain! The crunch of the sub when you bite into it is what gets you. Combine that with their meats and fresh veggies and you'll be in sandwich utopia in no time!

The Blaqcat man helped us keep a lookout when we began to get worried and then secured a closer parking spot after another customer left. And they made sure to check on us and our hookah. Also - awesome hot mint tea, served with fresh mint leaves. (Price was by pot, not single cup.) It went well with the wonderful ""trust me (trust Blaqcat man)"" fruity-minty flavor I asked for. (The flavor was watermelon something something.) I personally prefer really chill hookah lounges, not obnoxious nightclub-ish shite - now playing It Wasn't Me by Shaggy. Blaqcat hit the spot.

When I told the hostess that I was there for the Omakase, she showed us out of the restaurant to the store next door.  It was a very non-descript storefront.  When we entered, Chef Eric was waiting for us specifically and he really took us on a fantastic culinary journey.  Now remember, this shares a parking lot with a Chuck E. Cheese and a Denny's, so don't be surprised. I have had some amazing Omakase before, including at Sushi Nakazawa (whose owner\/chef was the apprentice of Sushi Master Yiro Ono) in NYC.

Bottomline, this place was great.  

This place is for the more experienced and at the risk of sounding slightly snobbish, dare I say serious sushi foodie.  You won't find any mayonnaise sauce drenched spicy crunchy roll conconctions here.

The place has no signage of it's own and was difficult to find if not for it's sister restaurant immediately next door that says Yummy Sushi.  This is the walk in place where you can find your usual spicy tuna rolls and such.  

They served 17 courses plus dessert and the entire service is about 2 to 2.5hrs so plan accordingly.  

The chef was interactive and was very knowledgeable with regards to the food served.  This added a lot to the experience and made it enjoyable.

There are 8 spots at the omakase counter so if you want to experience it you better plan ahead and get reservations. I dined with friends and once seated we were treated to over a dozen courses of creative dishes made from impeccable seasonal ingredients over the course of 3 hours. 

Unlike places like Kabuto where the atmosphere has an almost sacred feel to it where silence is preferred, Kame is more lively with Chef Eric and his sous engaging with our party and genuinely having fun as they prepared our meal. Also, unlike the more traditional Kabuto fare, the dishes at Kame are creative and modern where multiple ingredients are used for each dish to create unbelievable flavor profiles, like Maine lobster combined with uni, caviar, black truffle sea salt, toro, and yamamoto berry. Eaten individually or together, each bite was pure bliss.

Other standout dishes included king crab with torched uni butter; live uni over brown rice and hairy crab; and lobster claw with uni butter. The more minimal preparations -- the sushi -- were stellar, too. Each delicately crafted and formed or brushed with soy sauce to maximize the umami factor of each.

They may not get the press that top-tier dining destinations do, but the experience here is one of the best in the city."

I've a Yonaka homer but this place is out of the world.  They get fresh fish and steak shipped in from different parts of the world.  The chef is pretty cool- interactive while preparing your meal in front of you.  YES!!! You have to make reservations. Only two seatings per night- 6 pm and 830 pm for 8 people.  It's totally worth splurging to get an awesome experience.  The sushi nigiri is so fresh.  No need to dipped in soy sauce- they paints the fish with high grade imported soy sauce.  

If I'm not mistaken, I was 21 course meal- no worries most are one bite size.  My favorite dishes are the semiwrap fresh uni with toro, half&half blue fin tuna fat belly, A5 waygu steak, and lobster with uni on soba noodle.   I highly recommend this place."

Definitely one of the better omakase experiences I've had in US. Prices are very reasonable (then again, I'm used to the ridiculous SF prices), portion is just right, and variety was awesome. 

I love that you get served a full fresh lobster in many different ways (sashimi, chawanmushi, lobster meat ball, etc). Presentation was amazing and the experience was great. 

We even tried the hokkaido beef and was shown the certificate complete with the cow nose print. 

If I could give this place 6 stars, I would.

Oh, it's a little bit of a distance from the Strip so make sure you get there early. We were 25 min late to our reservation due to the crappy strip traffic and had to rush a little but finally managed to catch up with the rest. It didnt affect our experience though, and I'm super glad they still seated us despite being late.

10\/10. Would return again!"

- Macha and Kinakok Sochi

The most esquisite Omakase I had in 2016...not because the number of dishes we were offered, but the quality ingredients, components, and character of dishes...vibrant and exciting in such an artful form.  Chef Eric took his time to prepare some dishes, ever present in the moment of the evening, but equally mindful of us anxious Omakase lovers who await one bite after another...and let me tell you, he didn't skip a beat...artfully bringing forth the delicate conceptions of his mind for us to enjoy.

Often I don't know who's sitting next to me but I know for sure we've got something to talk about in common...food...pure, yet complex food by Chef Eric...I have no doubt that I will have other experiences at Kame throughout the year, but for sure we'll make a point to make a reservation at the end of 2017.

A little embarrassed to admit I'm a bit of a sushi snob now since I been to japan and I def would have to say this is one of my favorite places for omakase in the US so far! My first pick would be a restaurant in Seattle. But this was pretty impressive"

I'd gone to Yummy Sushi quite a few times before, but a foodie friend coming into town marked just the right occasion to finally try Kame.  Kame only serves an Omakase menu.  I understand the price varies -- on our night, it was $165 a person.  There are two seatings per night.  The restaurant is located through an unmarked entrance right beside Yummy Sushi, but you can also just go into Yummy and they'll take you to the right place.

We were 3 seafood lovers and one who was...not at all.  And so it's a testament to Chef Eric and his team that ALL of us ate EVERYTHING put in front of us.  On the night that we arrived we were the only diners, so it was a nice treat to sit at the bar to watch Chef Eric and his team prepare everything for what felt like a private affair.   

In total, we had 20 items.  I enjoyed every single morsel.  We had everything ranging from Chilean Sea Bass to Hokkaido Hairy Crab to Kama Toro and Otoro to Waygu beef, Lobster and Uni.  I learned that Kama Toro is an extremely rare cut of tuna - it's a cut of marbled tuna taken from the cheek.  Even if restaurants WANTED to purchase that section it's not always available.  What was really neat is that Chef Eric brought out the full slab of tuna cheek (that had just arrived earlier that day if I recall) so we can see what the full piece looked like and understand what we were eating.  These little touches made the meal that much more enjoyable.

Every preparation was delicious and flavourful.  I especially liked the subtle variations in sauces and seasonings placed on the nigiri.  I'm not usually a fan of mackerel and yet I devoured my piece of spanish mackerel topped with roasted sesame.   At the end of the meal, we were presented with a pineapple sorbet and a bowl of lemon water to rinse our fingers with.  An awesome dining experience overall!  Can't wait to take other friends.

If there was one thing that bothered my friends (but not me as much), it's that for such an experience, the TV playing basketball was a little distracting.  It was facing the guests and so I imagine it was preferred by some?  Not sure.

Please note, they have very strict reservation and cancellation policies.  $100 cancellation fee within 48 hours, no substitutions whatsoever.  They take your credit card when you make your reservations so make sure you are going!!"

We've been fortunate to experience many high end Omakase-style restaurants, but now we are totally spoiled by Kame Omakase!  Their pricing is VERY reasonable for the quality of food you get.  We're actually used to paying $250+\/person, so at $165\/person it's a deal! LOL!  Chef Eric is AMAZING...he's super friendly, knowledgeable & you tell by each detailed dish how passionate he is about what he does.  The only negative I can think of is that we have to hop a plane from Hawaii to Vegas to eat here, but absolutely worth it --- we're hooked!

This might not be the most expensive Omakase out there, but it is for me so far. With drinks and tips, total is about $490 for 2. Reservation is recommended, We came in May, but made the reservation in March. Two seating times available, 6pm seating or 8pm seating. So you will spend about 2 hours for dinner. There are about 16 courses, small course but very fulfilling. Maybe it's our lucky night, we had about 20. You want to sit at the bar (only about 6 seats available), at the bar you can see how the Chef prepare each dish. Not only he fed us, he also gave us lessons on each dish. Amazing!!! All the ingredients are fresh, he only serves in season items. So depends on the month you dine, you'll get different courses. A picture is better then a thousand words, so I've posted all the food we got during our dinner. (This is for one person)

I get 5 meals delivered to my gym and it saves me time and money and I know I'm getting some tasty\/healthy grub.

The real reason I'm writing this is because Basel and his crew really care about their customers. My bank updated my address and I didn't have time to update some recurring payments, one of which was F&K. Basel had emailed me about it but I missed the email. When I saw my card declined I quickly got on and updated it. The next morning I had 5 meals that I wasn't even expecting.

They didn't have to do that, it was totally my fault....but my stomach sure is glad they did.

This place produces by far best chicken pot pies in Vegas. My ultimate favorite crust is the cheddar crust which provides just a small kick of cheddar flavor.  When this place first opened, I remembered the pies had an overpowering rosemary taste. It took them a couple of weeks, but they perfected the recipe and flavors are on point. I tried the steak pot pie and wasn't a fan. The meat was very chewy and the pie was watery. The curry pot pie was delicious, however it was at about a spicy level 8. It would be cool to have a pot pie with potato and hamburger. Also, a bacon crust. The large size is perfect for three people. The apartment size is good for two people. The individual is a perfect proportion size for one person. I tend to get four frozen individual pies to keep in the freezer and two not frozen individual pies for dinner. Don't want to cook dinner, Pie Me Over really offers the perfect solution! The staff is very friendly and helpful. They provide service with a smile!"

I always found it hard to find someone who makes a pot pie just right. Let me tell you, this place has nailed it !

I was just getting over a cold so I was in need of some hot  food to get me through the night.
Saw this place and decided to come in.
They have chicken pot pie (regular ) veggie pot pies for you vegetarians :) chicken curry pot pies and sirloin pot pies.
I got the regular chicken pot pie with regular crust.

You bring these pies home and cook them in your oven so you can eat them fresh of course.
They give you a list of directions which was very helpful because my pot pie cooked beautifully in my oven.
Also pretty simple directions .

40 mins later I take my first bite and it was soo good guys.
Creaminess was perfect, wasn't over salted :)
The chicken was amazingly tender and it was like rotisserie chicken so it was in strips.
Veggies were soft and just right, and ate those up too !

This was one of the freshest pot pies I could have eaten.

Will definitely be coming back and I think I will be getting a chicken pot pie with cheddar crust next time! Yum.

Also you can accumulate points here! So every pot pie gets you more points:)

You want a good pot pie ? This is the place to try !"

So, I'm going to simple say... The Best Damn Chicken Pot Pie I have ever had, including homemade. We had the regular which is an excellent traditional chicken pot pie... the crust is exceptional... the gut is seasoned perfect... the right amount of fresh veggies... a little light on the chicken but taste great. 
Although they do offer frozen, I picked up the fresh, ""apartment"" size for the 2 of us. Took it home and baked it as directed. It took the full 50 mins and the wonderful smell throughout our house, of this cooking was almost unbearable. We couldn't even wait until it cooled properly to cut into it. 
Disappointed there wasn't any key lime pie... not sure if they were just out or they just don't offer it anymore. 
Not a big fan of the Indian Pudding even with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. more of an acquired taste and texture."

Call ahead to order your pies, since it will take about 45 mins for it to be ready, but it's worth it!

Every time I've called, the lady has always been friendly and knowledgeable. I've had two of their crusts so far, but between regular & garlic crust, I would go with regular. I love the crust. They have different types of pies and I've had the chicken pot pie and the curry chicken pie. I'm leaning towards the curry one as of now and have yet to try their chicken lovers pot pie but that's definitely next on my list.

The pricing is good for their size of the pot pies, and always more than enough for each of my meals. They even have a pot pie to go option, which I have yet to try, but will eventually!

Back then it said ""Touch Of Aloha"". Then later name changed to ""House Of Aloha"" to me it didn't matter until Aunty over there told me the story and you know what ""House Of Aloha"" is mo bettah anyway. Reason being is the story behind it and what Aunty and Uncle had to go through to get to where they're at now.

It's a little hidden and you'll last it if you're not really looking for it but eh it's ok cuz it's still awesome. The location doesn't make the spot, it's the food and customer service that makes the spot.

As I walked up to the door there was a display board like a black board with different color letting showing the current days specials. Definitely brought back that plate lunch spot feeling to my stomach. And all of us from Hawaii know that feeling. And you can't get that from no LnL out here lol.

I walk in and was immediately greeted with that Aloha spirit. I guess we all just know if you from Hawaii the moke Hawaiian comes out lol 

I ordered dozen pork hash, half dozen manapua, 6 pastele, and Large Chow Fun. 4 items that you can't get any where else. 
I had to wait like 20 minutes for some fresh pork hash but braaaaahhhh, I'm glad I did. Aunty let me sample the one that was sitting for little while and this buggah was so good. Nice and meaty just like how pork hash supposed to taste. Then she says, wait till you try it fresh lol..well, she wasn't lying at all..these bad boys taste amazing fresh.
The manapua bread is so damn soft. Like really really soft. Better than Libby and chun wah kam. It's not like cardboard or crumby. It holds perfect and it's the right ratio to char siu inside..I'm eating these as I'm making this review lol.
Haven't tried the pastele yet because I bought it frozen so gotta take it home and steam it. But the pasteles are huuuuge lol. And uncle said one puerto rican made it sooooo you know it was made great and with TLC.
The Chow fun taste exactly like how I remembered from back home.

Lemme tell you, you will not, I REPEAT YOU WILL NOT be disappointed. If you want some island food like how you remembered from Hawaii and wanna feel like you're in Hawaii again, head on over to ""HOUSE OF ALOHA"" and meet the family over there.

However, they have wonderful meat and produce sales that I tend to stick to. One of their specials that I have had is their carne asada that you can purchase per pound at their meat counter. IT IS AMAZING!!! They have a large bulk foods section that has anything from lentils to chocolate covered espresso beans. A great way to try new grains, nuts, and spices without having to commit to buying a whole package. The store also has a decent size natural beauty and health care section that I need to check out."

Sprouts has always had the best produce and the organic selection is the freshest and largest around.

I was pretty excited to see this store open. I'd never been to a Sprouts and I've been missing the convenience of Fresh and Easy since it closed. Since it opened I've been in a few times. They do have a really nice produce section as well as a variety of things you might not find at regular stores (special vitamins, essential oils etc.). Unfortunately they don't have a lot of things on my grocery list and every time I've gone in, I end up having to still run into Albertsons across the street to pick up things they didn't have. Some of their prices are really good and other things are priced super high. For example, I think that regular Dryer's ice cream was $5.99 the last time I was there whereas you can get it at the regular store for $2.99 on sale. Because it's a smaller store, there isn't a lot of selection either. Like with the ice cream example, let's say you go to Albertsons (or Smiths or Vons) and the Dryers is not on sale - you can usually find a generic or another brand that is a cheap price. Not so here. I just could't bring myself to pay $6 for a small carton of ice cream and every other brand was just as expensive. Similar experience with butter. Every type was way over-priced. Like double what I normally pay. The Sprouts brand was the only one that was priced half way decently (still more than I usually pay) but they were all out. They were out of several brands of milk as well and a few that I picked up expired on the day I was shopping. Last time I was there I was in the mood for some bagged salad- just the crappy iceburg kind, but every bag of it looked brown. The first couple times I went in, the employees were super friendly and helpful. The last time I went in, I dealt with an off shift employee still in her uniform shopping with her husband and rudely pushing her way around the store, cutting me off etc. and when I got in line, the cashier was busy talking to another employee as was the bagger (they had 2 different conversations going on). I felt like I was disturbing them by being there. Neither said a word to me during the whole transaction. At any rate, I just feel as though this store didn't live up to all the hype surrounding it. I might drop in if I'm only needing one or two items and I need to get in and out fast, but it will not be where I do my regular shopping for sure."

They mostly sell natural and organic products although not all of their stuff is organic. Their produce and meat is always fresh and of great quality. They have competitive weekly sales which makes most of their products (especially produce) an equal or lesser price than their local\/nearby competitors.

Ample parking. It is within a complex that is still building up. Once the plaza gets going, not sure if I can say the same. 

Pretty much everything you need or find at a Sprouts near you, this is just the same. 

I did notice one thing! When I approached their deli because I wanted to buy a sandwich, someone working towards the back was doing their job by constantly looking up. I was immediately greeted then asked if I needed help, which I extremely appreciated! I've visited the deli at the Lake Mead location and I swear tis as if no one works back there. Grrr.

Obviously having just opened...it is going to be clean, it is going to feel fresh and new in there, and customer service will be on point. Let's just hope management enforces consistency because that seems like a lost word in the customer service world amongst businesses. Consistency is important! So I hope they consistently keep up with the customer service.

There is SO MUCH more parking that the Centennial Hills TJ's! I know that a lot of the retail spaces aren't open in this shopping center yet so it may be early to judge, but I am holding onto my hope that the parking stays decent. 
Sprouts has an awesome selection of food and other goods. We have stopped in a few times and last night I was able to snag some natural deodorant and hairspray. I was thrilled-it was much cheaper than shopping online and they had a HUGE selection of deodorants to choose from. 
They have plenty of single-serve cold drinks and ready-to-heat meals. They have a pretty vast candy selection-but they don't have the bulk salt water taffy! A travesty! 
We have had positive interactions with the staff on all of our visits, and they all seem happy to be at work and eager to help.

The training and instruction is top notch here. Professor Hector is a very knowledgeable black belt under Cobrinha. He focuses on all his student on and off the mat, as well as helping visitors learn the techniques. He encourages students to ask questions on the technique of the day or just any technique the student has in mind.

Another cool thing about this gym is that a lot of famous jiu jitsu practitioners come here to visit. Just to name a few Cobrinha (obviously), Miyao, Denilson Pimenta, Bruno Malfacine.

The jiu jitsu itself is amazing. This was not the gym I started my Jiu Jitsu journey, but how my game has evolved since I started training here is baffling. Come here and roll to see for yourself!"

After one week, he informed me of my kids strengths and weaknesses. His perspective didn't differ from my own assessments. My son needs to be more aggressive while my daughter needs to pay attention to detail\/technique. 

We currently have them in Summer Camp and our kids are loving the opportunity to learn and they are flourishing in the combative environment. In Summer Camp they have two workout sessions a day with exercise activities and games. During the breaks the kids and read or take naps. I've noticed my kids are more knowledgeable in Jiu Jitsu concepts and verbiage than I would've ever have imagined. They are 8 and 10 respectably.

I felt like every time I went to class, I was pretty much just a sparring dummy for the higher belts, who weren't interested in teaching me and just interested in smashing me and submitting me. When I decided to look for a school recently to get back into jiu jitsu, and also for my girlfriend to join, I actually went back to my old school to observe a class... and it was still the same. Higher belts on one side of the room and the beginners left to themselves on the other side of the room. Another big thing was the lead instructor was not present... That same night, I went to observe a class at Cobrinha. The first person I met was Hector Vasquez. He asked me right then and there if I wanted to put on a gi and participate in the class. I said I would like to just watch for now. The class starts off with Hector teaching the whole class a move\/technique, and the class pairs up and drills the move. This is the warmup. No carrying your partner on your back across the room and back, forward rolling across the room, backward rolling across the room, shrimping across the room, etc., so that by the time you start to teach, everyone is already tired. While the students are drilling, Hector is walking around, observing each student, and making corrections\/adjustments as needed. After the drilling\/warmup, there is sparring. Throughout the class, the higher belts are mixing it up and working with lower belts and helping them. After the class was done, Hector talked to me some more, and told me that he makes it a point to be the one teaching every single class. Even if there are higher belts present, he will still be the one teaching. And by teaching, he is actually teaching, not messing around on his phone and letting people do whatever and potentially hurt themselves or the people they are rolling with. This sold me. I brought my girlfriend the next morning, and we both signed up after participating in the class. I am so glad we found this school. It really is a family atmosphere where every one wants to help each other get better. You can really tell that Hector is dedicated and passionate about teaching. Whether you are just starting out, or you are looking to maybe change schools, come check out Cobrinha and decide for yourself. I thought when you're just starting out, it doesn't matter much which school you go to, because they are all the same in teaching the basics. That is completely incorrect. I feel like I have learned and progressed infinitely more in the 3 months that I have been at Cobrinha, than I did in the 8 months that I trained at the other school. AND I enjoy coming to class so much more here! They are about to start adding an additional early morning class to accommodate more people's schedules. So come check out the school. I'm glad I did!"

The instruction and training is unmatched. Safety is always a top priority and every child is very closely monitored. 
It is very fitting that his slogan is ""evolve your game"" because that's exactly what happens when you train here!! Our daughter has not only grown leaps and bounds technically, but her self confidence has skyrocketed! 
I think what makes all the difference is Professor Vasquez's passion for what he does. He cares so deeply about every one of his students.

We were very unhappy with his previous gym so with a recommendation from a friend we reluctantly tried Cobrinha BJJ. However, the moment we stepped into the gym we were warmly greeted by Professor Hector and his staff. He explained to us his philosophies and gave us a brief background of his bjj education and accomplishments. Following our meeting my son participated in a trial class and it soon became apparent that his first 4 months of training was a joke. In the first day at Cobrinha,  he learned techniques and verbiage that he had never learned previously. Professor, the other coaches and the kids were very patient and willing to help him throughout the session. I couldn't believe the amount of unity and willingness to help that everyone has. After leaving we knew that this was the place that we need our son to train. It has been 7 months now and my son has participated in 3 tournaments and has won all 3 (including Pan Kids 2017). His growth and accomplishments are all because Cobrinha BJJ has given him the tools he needs to be an amazing fighter and person. Because at Cobrinha, Professor's philosophies of bjj are not only applicable on the mat but off as well.

In the first few weeks I saw improvements in my sons' and I, and we have been building on that regularly. My sons have competed in tournaments and have grown through those experiences, thanks to Cobrinha. 

Not only is it a great school to improve your BJJ it's an academy with great families who are welcoming and kind. All of the the coaches\/instructors are top notch and caring. For example, Coach Robert for the 7 am class is experienced and passionate. Coach Ryan in the kids class is always encouraging my sons and giving guidance on improvements.   I am regularly impressed by Professor Hector (owner). He challenges the students to become the best version of ourselves both mentally and physically; he takes opportunities to challenge students to become better people in their everyday lives.

I've been around for over a year now and finally got around to writing a long-overdue review. It's worth a read for anyone who wants to learn more about this Academy. 

Below I thoroughly highlight areas worth discussing about the Academy. 

KIDS PROGRAM
Professor Hector is amazing with the kids, and it shows with the continuous growth in enrollment. Parents rely on him to ensure their child(ren) learn not only the sport, but discipline and hard work. His kids class put in serious work. It's crazy to see how he seamlessly manages 40+\/- kids on the mat. He knows just how to handle the kids, regardless of their personalities and ages. Just watch a class, and you will see how much the kids respect Professor and the assistant coaches. 

BJJ ALL LEVELS
This is the class with mostly adults and some kids\/teens. What's interesting is seeing the growth in parents who are now taking part in their children's lifestyle. Couples, too, are joining together. It doesn't matter what belt color or fitness level you're at, Professor will make it work for you. 

COMMUNITY
It's a family environment, which means anyone is welcome. Even if you don't practice BJJ and have a family member or partner that does it, you'd still be drawn in. 

PROFESSOR HECTOR
For someone who sees about 50-100+ people daily, he knows every single member's name, and to me that says a lot about how sincere and passionate he is. He's not just there to do a job. He gets to know you and your weaknesses and strengths and helps you to develop an efficient way of training. During technique drills, he goes around the class and really pays attention to details and will ensure you have the proper form. As a white belt, I think that's important and he helps explain the mechanics\/use of the move. 

Of significance to me is how accommodating he is -- when I was pregnant, he provided a safe training environment that enabled me to train up until I gave birth. Because I continued to train, I was able to stay flexible and thus had an easy birth. I came back, over a month later, and he continues to encourage and challenge me to get back to a more consistent\/hard training. 

In addition to teaching, Professor also makes it a point to impart some words of wisdom or inspiration at the end of class sometimes. It serves to motivate us lest we become complacent. That's the kind of mentor\/coach you want; not someone who easily dismisses the class after teaching. He cares--a lot. 

Many people look to a leader who's obviously good at what they teach. So whether it's scholastics or sports, we all want to learn from champions, professionals, and highly decorated athletes.  There's a difference between being the best at something and being able to teach it. So, one thing to keep is mind is -- ""But how well can they teach?"" Professor Hector exemplifies both the expertise in the sport and in teaching it. So whether you're serious about BJJ or simply want to learn and be part of the community, this is the place to be."

I got the local beer Gypsy Fade which was a great balanced IPA. I've never tried any vegas local beers and I'm glad this place carries them.
For the entree, I got the Wine Glazed Short Ribs.. it was soooo tender and flavorful, so amazing.
As to when I thought it couldn't get any better, I finished off my experience with the Tiramisu dessert and it was worth it. Every bite felt like heaven in my mouth LOL

Also had the calamari for an appetizer and it was very crunchy and tasty with that zesty flavor! 

For desserts the hazelnut torta with salted caramel gelato on top, very very delicious and most of all the Salted caramel budino was to die for !!!

For alcoholic beverages , I tried the julietta (floral light refreshing cocktail ) matched well with the mussels appetizer according to the friend i dined with , the sangria was really tasty and just the right amount of sweetness, apricot cocktail  was refreshing too , and most of all the Apple bourbon cocktail was my favorite !!

It was a beautiful restaurant, aesthetically the patio and interior were modern and rustic. It was a simple layout but so charming and quaint. 

As they were preparing for their grand opening today was another training day. Our table's server was exquisite, she was definitely helpful and friendly. The only downside to the service was our server was constantly being intruded upon by her trainer that it was becoming really rude. My table was in the middle of placing our main dish orders and the trainer pulled our server aside to have a conversation with her about something. And honestly it was extremely rude on the trainers part to have interrupted our order, it could've waited until after. I have to give complete credit to Paulina for being amazing ensuring we were doing great! She exhibited the perfect quality of service! 

Now for the food! Let's talk about yummy! The prosciutto bruschetta was tasty! It was the perfect amount of asparagus and prosciutto on top of lightly charred bread. It was very light and refreshing! Personally I ordered the Bolognese, I thought I was great! The only thing I wish was the noodles were more al dente, I thought they were a little over cooked. But still delicious! The marinara was light but full of flavor!

And let's talk about dessert!! The lemon donuts were delicious! I was a sugared dough with a custard-like filling on top of a lemon-type glaze. We also ordered tiramisu which was my favorite! I loved the little malted crunch balls on top which I felt balanced out the espresso part."

Good to know cause I'd really like to try more like the Gumbo & Rice bowls I read about.  

My friend & I first grabbed a six-pack of Franziskaner Hefeweizen which paired well w\/ Chef Darrell's creations.  

Our order was slightly mixed up, but no problem, Chef brought us an Old Bay seasoned, Spicy Shrimp Taco.  It said w\/ Blue Chips, but it came w\/ a salad & all three items we got were on a Hoagie Roll.  It worked well as a sandwich, instead of a taco too.  We took off one bun from each order & then could really taste the elements of each sandwich.  I loved this spicy shrimp & slaw creation!  It had a nice kick of Sriracha & garlic aioli which I love!

The Thai Style Beef Satay Tri-Tip was a strip of Beef Satay On a Hoagie topped w\/ a nice sweet cucumber, carrot salad.  I really liked the sweet sauce on top of it & it would also be great as a salad!  

My fav was the Smoked Pork Belly Banh Mi On a Hoagie, topped w\/ coleslaw & pickled onions & cilantro!  I should've taken one to-go so will have to hope that it's on the menu next time.

Honestly, the bagels at Weiss and Bagel cafe are just a tad better. Also, they have salt bagels which are my favorite. But Jamboree didn't have salt bagels. However all of that is minor. Overall the bagels got 4 out of 5 stars from me, the cream cheese was delish and gets 5 out of 5 stars from me and the apple fritters..... well they get a 10 out of 5 stars from me! Literally the best apple fritters I've ever had!! I'd also give the service 5 out of 5 stars. They're a new small business to the area and I definitely plan to support them more!

I had a fun experience on a food tour a few months back on the Las Vegas strip with TasteBuzz food tours, and I saw that they offered an afternoon tour in downtown Las Vegas.  I decided to sign up on the website, and with one click I signed up and experienced yet another enjoyable tour!  

What makes the tours with TasteBuzz so enjoyable is how well-thought out they are.  Not only are you experiencing the array of tastes and flavors of the food on the tour, but you also get to explore the city with an incredible guide!  The downtown tour starts at one of the city's most renowned and celebrated streets, Fremont Street!  While on Fremont Street you really see how much the landscape and streetscape changes as you pass through the one of a kind Container Park, then into the bar hopper's paradise of Fremont East, and suddenly you enter an area (with so many things happening at once including people zip lining, extraordinary street performers and on this particular day a concert) known as The Fremont Street Experience.   At this stop Kathy, the guide, brought us to a food truck that serves up the most tender and zesty barbecue you will ever have!  Prior to indulging in the food here, we were educated on the different styles of barbeque including what distinguishes the styles of barbeque found in different parts of the country. 

In downtown Las Vegas it is really remarkable to see the contrast between the casinos downtown and the megaresorts on the Las Vegas strip.  During the tour you have the opportunity to step inside and capture the essence that makes these casinos so legendary!  There will also be some unusual sites to take in at these properties while touring!  Actually, you get to go to an unexpected place to find a piece of history that forever changed a nation!    

You also get to eat some items from the menu at a local's favorite restaurant including a food that the entire world adores!  In addition, you get to find out about the champion chef that is behind it all!  There is so much more tremendous food and sightseeing on this tour!  Both of the tours I have been on through TasteBuzz food tours created experiences that feature great food, great people, and magnificent sightseeing!"

They could've earned 5 stars with better customer service.  

I ordered takeout via Yelp.  A large order. I was very detailed on my order so there would be no confusion.  I ended my order asking nicely for plates, cheese and pepper flakes please.  

We needed the food at the house before 7:30pm for the start of the playoff game.  I placed the order at 6:32pm.  The website said we would receive the food in 35 minutes.

After a large order of pizza, pasta, wings and dessert, I got a phone call from the restaurant.  They sold out of meatballs.  On a Friday night ... at 6:30pm.   I replaced it with Ravioli and Chicken Parm.  

It took forever on the phone call.  They asked my what flavors I wanted on the wings...even though I already ordered them with flavors indicated.  She said she had no idea.  She asked whether we wanted ranch or blue cheese... even though I already indicated what I wanted in the original order.  

Let's say NOT A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE GETTING MY ORDER RIGHT.  

At this point it's 6:45pm.  I asked how long for the takeout to be ready. She says 45 minutes.  I say that's too late... can you deliver?  She says yes but it's a $4 delivery fee.  

Serious??  Their mistakes and errors are making the order late, and they can't waive the $4 deliver fee??

6:30pm rolls around, no delivery.  We literally live 3 minutes from the restaurant.  At 6:45pm, I call and they say that the food is on the way.  It arrives at 6:50pm.  One hour and twenty minutes after the original order.  

No plates as requested.  No cheese or pepper flakes.  

If I was the owner or manager, I'm including a cannolli or a cupcake or a couple sodas... or anything that says ""sorry, we're new to your neighborhood and we made a mistake, but we want a second chance for your business.""  

Food wasn't bad. We would've returned with better service. Like the reviews on their Henderson location, they are stingy on pizza toppings.  Tough to understand given that they charge $15-18 per pizza. 

We usually go to Rocco's which is good and has a bigger menu.  Or we takeout at Bambino's which is excellent.  Sadly we probably won't return to this location.  Poorly executed and even more poorly serviced."

Really good seafood, very flavorful and fresh, served in a no-frills eastside downtown location. Loved the aguachiles shrimp, the carne asada, the molcajetes and the fish tacos too. The fried fish has this really crispy but thin coating that is just the best! I am used to cabbage with fish tacos, so the lettuce they came with was a bit weird, but maybe that's a regional preference? The mango chela and micheladas were great; as was their Jamaica, which was tart, fresh-tasting, very cold...delicious!
The salsas are excellent, and the tortillas were fresh. But we didn't eat much of the beans that came with the meals...they had no taste at all. 
The only thing we kinda regretted ordering was the fried ice cream. It was frozen much too hard (in my experience, fried ice cream is frozen hard, THEN put into a deep fryer for a just a bit, before serving it, to soften it and crisp up the coating); and it was not served in the ""cone bowl"" as earlier reviews had pictured it.

Tucked in the back of the Inn-Zone gaming bar off US-95 and Rainbow, Hemant serves up authentic Kerala street food. 

Having lived in Singapore for some time, I was taken right back to Serangoon Road when I tasted the curry leaf in the Kappa and Konj. Beautifully spiced prawns on a bed of creamy mashed tapioca. Loved the heat! Probably the highlight of the meal.

Masala chicken chunks perfectly seasoned and tender with basmati rice = a classic biriyani (served in a clay pot added much appreciated presentation). 

Though not often pointed out by most diners - I love when a chef executes a perfect, simple salad. A light ponzu dressing of hand selected lettuces, elegantly seasoned with picked red onions.

Hemant is a consummate professional, executing top notch cuisine. His unique expression of regional Indian cooking is informative, inspiring, and give us a taste of India far beyond butter chicken, dahl, and naan."

We were attracted by the 40 reviews with a 5 star rating. There is no name on the restaurant from the outside of the building, It turns out its inside this self professed dive bar. I walked in and asked the bartender where the Toddy Shop was and he pointed to this cut out in the wall. The food is a self order, delivered on chinette paper plates and plastic forks. So, it's raw from a dining experience, but delicious from every other perspective. I have to say it was some of the most flavorful Indian food I've ever had and I consider myself an Indian Food snob. It's not a full menu, but what they served was off the charts. We had a Pompano sautéed fish with well blended aromatic flavors and the Chicken Biryani rice dish was infused with so much flavor and the chicken tender....it was just so friggin good!! They also have pub food, wings, fries and burgers. I would definitely look at the menu. We found out, this is a temporary secret and they are in search of a new place to serve this fantastic fare"

We also had the Asian persuasion burger - I wasn't a fan of the sesame seed bun but my boyfriend loved it - and the Indian chop suey, which was essentially noodles fried crispy-hard with sautéed veggies and it was very, very spicy but still flavorful.

I was craving Indian food and decided to give Toddy Shop a try. I ordered take out to bring home to the family. I I would've enjoyed most of the food more had I eaten it there. Most of the dishes were tasty. Their homemade chips are so GOOOD! Here's a little bit of background, the place specializes in making Southern Indian specialty dishes that is often ordered in a bar or on the street. Now, I don't know if it's authentic, but for sure it was different and tasty. It didn't have the typical Indian food feel you'd get at Indian Palace or Mint such as curry dishes. 

TIP: This place is located in Inn-Zone Bar. The signs for the Toddy Shop is very small and not very visible for those driving by. I drove around for a couple of minutes looking for a stand-alone restaurant, then realized it was in the bar. It's all the way in the back and order at a small window. 

FOOD: The menu is limited. I primarily focused on the specialty dishes. We had the following: 

1. Pot of Biriyani: The menu states this is fragrant basmati, chicken masala, ghee, cashew, raisin and crispy onion. My favorite part of this dish is the basmati and raisins! 

2. Queen Karimeen: I LOVED this dish, but it is messy and you'll need to be careful because the spiced rubbed, flash fried Pompano fish has bones in it. It was so good and went amazing with the house made chips. The best way to eat it is with your hands. It's huge so you can definitely share this dish with someone. 

3. Rajah Masala - this is a mixture of chips and nutty salsa with a nice spicy kick to it. I recommend getting this is a starter to share with everyone. It comes with a side of homemade chips you use to dip in the rajah masala. 

4. Kothu Parotta: multi-layered flaky flat bread with stir fried veggies, chili beef and assorted chips on the side. The meat of the dish was yummy and I mixed it in with the Pot of Biriyani. The chili beef had a citrus taste to it that went well with the stir fried veggies (primarily broccoli) 

SERVICE: The lady who took my order was very nice. She noticed me right when I came up to the window. She guided me through the menu and made her own recommendations. All the food is made fresh, so expect to wait. It took about 35 minutes for my food to be ready. I recommend having the chips packaged separately so they don't get soggy if you're ordering take-out. 

PRICE: This place is a little on the pricey side. For all four dishes, the check came out to roughly $69 w\/ taxes and tip. You can get a stamp card where I can get a free entree after a certain amount of purchases. 

Overall, my experience with the Toddy Shop was good. I would come back again to try the other dishes like the Rasta Wings and Indian Chopsuey. They also have burgers too. 

Happy Dining,

When my co-worker mentioned that the food at Toddy Shop reminded him of the cuisine from his Dad's region of South India, I figured this place would be good. It did not disappoint. We ordered the Hawt Wings (for my son), Queen Karimeen, Rasta Wings, and Chicken Manchurian (an off-the-menu special). My son absolutely loved the Hawt Wings... the heat was just right for him and the accompanying fries were excellent. (I stole a few!) The Queen Karimeen was awesome... moist, flaky, flash-fried Pompano fish with perfect seasoning and a just-right spicy masala. The Chicken Manchurian was great as well. It has a touch more spice than what my girlfriend liked, but it was spot-on for my palette. The Rasta Wings paired well with the hoppy IPA I had at home.

Just to reiterate the other observations here, this place is slightly smoky sports bar. And, of course, it is 21 and over... so no bringing the kids here. But the food is worth any inconvenience you may encounter. This was a beautifully made meal and the attention to detail from the chef was very evident. I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu!"

Our past  experiences has taught us that sometimes the best places to eat is where comfort food is served with passion .We decided after a long day of work and about the town ..we worked up an appetite to try this place .

We ordered my personal fav (anytime of the year) something I crave the moment we land in Kerala.... which is a Spice Rubbed, Flash Fried fish marinated in a  Onion-Tomato Masala Wrapped & Steamed in a Banana Leaf...  the real treat is to able to smell the warm aromatic yet comforting spice mix across the kitchen while cooking ...and even better when  able  to recreate the Kerala flavors within the first  bite  ....it  takes us back to our vacation days with our granny .This is a stellar dish that you can't miss.

My husband ordered which is an all time Kerala favorite Kappa &Konj which is a Turmeric Mashed Tapioca with Shrimp Masala tempered Mustard Seeds, Curry Leaf, red chilli.. This is a typical comfort  food for any Keralite especially when you had a long day of work... nothing is more scrumptious than having to fill up on the spicy flavours of the shrimp accompanied with steamed turmeric flavored  tapioca. This by far one of the best dishes we've had in a while ..

During  our meal, we meet Hemant (chef) for a quick chat. We were applauded by the humility  and passion he has for south indian cooking with a twist ..which often many people do not realise Indian cooking (is not all about naan and butter chicken people!!!!)... we do have regional oriented cooking like south indian cooking and  Hemant has mastered the art of whipping up classic dishes !!! :)

To seal  the deal right before we left the place... we noticed Hemant and his crew was whipping up what we would call the holy grail of desserts -the jackfruit jam... now any one from Kerala would know the jackfruit jam  is any day better than  all the twinkes , smores ,churros and sweet crepes you can have...and yet again Hemant was able to recreate the flavors of home...  The sweet gooeyness , and the savory of the jackfruit with spices can make any one smile. The prefect way to end the meal .

All in all I would say we would definitely come back to this place when we are in town as we love the food experience and the friendly crew out there!!!"

Who the hell is doing stuff like deep fried banana peppers in a spiced chickpea batter (Chilli Bajji) or doing a non-Thai whole pompano fish?  Nobody!  That's why this place rocks.  

Our group bulldozed through almost the whole menu and here's what I am definitely having again:

Rasta Wings:  Spicy and a little sweet, these babies were perfectly fried.  Buffalo wings can take a back seat to these jerks any day.   

Biryani:  Complex flavor profile where the mouth get hits from all angles in one bite, along with that oh-so-fucking-tender chicken made this a clear winner.  It was the best version of the popular mixed rice dish that I've had in a long time.  

Asian Persuasion One:  Not one second of persuasion needed for this Asian to devour the living hell out of this burger!  Hell yes to Mongolian beef, grilled shrimp and gochujang aioli on a grilled sesame brioche bun.   It honestly hurt to share and I never plan on doing that ever again.  A perfectly cooked sunny side up egg makes everything better including this.    

If there is anything to gripe over, it's Inn Zone Bar itself.  I attempted to dine here a couple of weeks before only to enter an insanely smoky atmosphere that made me believe they could only be burning Marlboro Reds like incense, which prompted an exit in less than 30 seconds.  You should plan on wearing it out.   But the food is so damn good; I'd even tolerate being seated between Marge Simpson's sisters for it.

Thank you so much for regarding our comments on the spice level of your food.  It was taste bud awakening!  The lady (my apologies for not getting her name) is right - the spice is strong but the flavors in the food can still be tasted.  There was nothing wrong at all with it, just spicier than I expected, however it kicked butt!  For those with a sensitive tongues, you may ask to lessen the 'spice bite'.  Otherwise it is wonderful and packed with flavor punches!

Located straight to the back of Inn Zone bar you'll find this seemingly hidden kitchen.  Don't let the stoop down order window fool you.  Cuz back there is where miracles happen with the food that's on their menu.  What you see around you is a mirage.  What you'll feed yourself will take you yet elsewhere.  The 6 pack chef makes you some food one would least expect for a bar scene.  Bring. It. On!

Rajah Masala comes with house made chips; Rasta Wings has house made chips and plantains; and Pot of Biryani is plenty enough for two people.  Each dish has their own personality.  The Rajah Masala is one of those perfect chip scooping munchies that goes well with a few beers, let's say.  It has loads of peanuts and mixed up with veggies like a salsa.  Actually a healthy snack.  Rasta Wings has a beautiful balance of sweet and spice - great combo with the plantains.  Pot of Biryani of course my fave type of meal with everything in one.  Loved it!

Here you will get your spicy cravings handled!!!  Don't forget to give warm greetings to the kitchen crew and Chef Hemant.  You spice up our lives!"

It's located inside Inn Zone, but is moving to a new location very soon. Those who are from Vegas or have lived here long enough remember the days of Inn Zone (multiple locations then with family run business inside) having some of the best food in town, one in particular would regularly have a line out the door just for a bucket of their delicious chicken fingers. With that said, I'd never find it shocking or be surprised to still be able to get a really tasty meal at this now dive bar that could use a makeover. The dining area was clean and I personally wasn't bothered nor smelled any cigarette smoke, but I'm in a fucking bar in Vegas, so it wouldn't have bothered me anyway. Alcohol, food and cigarettes will happen in a bar... get over it. 

Chef Hemant is the mastermind behind the menu at Toddy Shop. It's clear how genuinely passionate he is about the food being served and service to customers. Chef came out during our meal to make sure we liked it and answered and questions about some of the dishes on the menu. 

Our table shared many dishes family style and several things stood out for me. Certain things I was also eating for the first time and it was nice to venture out of my comfort zone to try something different. One thing hubby and I both thought had great flavor was the Rasta Wings that came with some delicious fried plantain on the side. Another dish that stood out was the Pot of Biriyani that had basmati rice, chicken masala, ghee, cashews, raisins and crispy onions which has excellent flavor. Everything we tried right down to the double-cut fried potatoes (ask for Indian ketchup to dip your fries in and thank me later) tasted really good and all of us agreed we'd come back.

At that time, I told him I'd be there.  I got a message from him yesterday saying he was serving the duck for this weekend only.  I instantly changed my dinner plans and alter went to the Toddy Shop at the Inn Zone sports bar on Rainbow.

I ordered the duck and puri which he was making for the weekend too.  He asked me if there was anything else I wanted and I ordered rice which it turned out I didn't need.  There was enough food without it.

In a short time, he called to me as he put the dishes on the shelf of the small kitchen's counter.  A nice bowl of bone in duck pieces and a large dish with two very large puri and some rice.  I had already gotten my Coke at the bar and I was ready to dig in.

The sauce was excellent.  He asked me if it was too hot.  He could tone it down for me if I wanted.  I didn't--it was perfect.  The puri were larger than I expected but they were crispy on the outside and moist inside with a bit of a salty taste.  A nice complement to the duck.  With some leftover rice and puri, I cleaned out the bowl of the remaining sauce and I left very content.

Well, it was a pleasant surprise for a group of us to see some of our native food (only 3 of them though) in the menu. First of all, this place is a little place in the corner of a bar and is not easy to find. 

We ordered biriyani and kappa with konchu. Didn't order the fish because it said pompano clearly in the menu instead of pearl spot fish which is normally used for that dish. But eating a proper malabar biryani and kappa\/konchu would have made the trip for us.  But to our utter disappointment, the biryani was basmati rice mixed(in the to go package) with some store purchased chicken tikka masala(my hunch). Not to exaggerate, the real malabar biriyani fans would choke at the sight of this dish. Konchu was ok, but Kappa was big pieces just steamed - not the variety which normally goes with konchu or fish curry. Not to mention a surprisingly high $16 - $19 for these dishes. 

In short, this is a cleverly marketed (misusing a  nostalgic brand -  Kallu (Toddy) - please don't use this name if you don't serve toddy - my humble request ) place, but unfortunately doesn't even come close to the expectations. The two stars  is to this guy's entrepreneurship efforts.  Coming to terms that if you need authentic Kerala food, you need to be in Kerala.

Disclaimer: My review is solely based on the ethnic Kerala cuisine on the menu. Other dishes on the menu might or might not be doing justice to the excellent ratings. I know my Kerala food."

The menu isn't very big nor authentic but I enjoyed what I had. I don't really understand the few Asian items on the menu because there are too few to call it a ""fusion"" restaurant.
I got the California burrito with the carne asada. I love the concept of putting tater tots on the burrito. It was delicious but the carne asada was not anywhere near the best I've ever had. Pretty dry. But overall I liked it. The green salsa is amazing but they don't give you a lot. They should have containers near the salsa station so you can take some to go.
My boyfriend loved his burrito but said the habanero salsa was a bit too sweet. He liked how spicy it was.
We also ordered the shrimp ceviche. It was nothing special. Still good but wouldn't order again.

We were lucky enough to try their food during their first day of business and it was so good that our whole office had to go back for lunch the following day! I always had their Henderson location on my bookmarks but never had the chance to make it out there so I was ecstatic to find out they are open really close to my workplace. This is probably going to be a dangerous thing for me because I'm probably going to end up eating here every lunch break. The service is extremely friendly and you can tell they're really passionate about their food. 

Their Kalbi Mission Burrito consists of sweet, Korean kalbi paired with pico de gallo, guacamole, cheese and spanish rice. I was also able to try the Carnitas Mission Burrito and the meat is so flavorful and tender. The Carne Asada Taco has queso fresco crumbles and it's really refreshing since I'm used to usual places just adding the typical shredded cheese.

Their salsas are awesome! Mildest to hottest-- Roja, Verde and Habanero. I'm not a fan of super spicy but a little bit of habanero on my burrito gave it an extra kick. It's sweet at first then somehow, it hits you hard at the end. It's reaaaally good. 

I also loved their Pineapple Basil Agua Fresca. You can really taste the basil but it doesn't overpower the sweetness of the pineapple juice. I was also able to try all their churros-- original, caramel filled and bavarian cream filled. All had a sweet cinnamon sugar exterior and the texture was crunchy not soggy or chewy. My favorite would have to be the bavarian cream. I think the caramel was a bit too sweet for my liking and the bavarian cream balanced out the cinnamon sugar more so I prefer that. 

You know it's so good when you're still eating your food but you're already thinking of what you'll order next when you come back. Be back real soon, Me Gusta Tacos!"

I had 3 tacos that came with a side of chips. I ate the pork belly, kalbi, and carne asada tacos. They are just a little bigger than a street taco so 3 was plenty for a meal, especially with the side of chips. 

In the restaurant there's a little mini fridge with some salsas you can bring back to your table. A red salsa, green salsa, and habanero. Each salsa is labeled with the level of spice where red is 4\/10, green is 6\/10 and habanero is 9\/10. They all taste amazing! The habanero is definitely 9\/10. Though, I feel like the red and green are backwards. The green is a sweet salsa, and I'd give it 2\/10 for a spice level. The red has a little kick, but it's not really spicy. That one I'd give a 4\/10. 

I also dig the decor of the place. It felt modern and clean. Interesting take on the fake grass on the walls.

Now open for 19 months at The District at Green Valley Ranch and recently expanding westward to 7425 South Durango Drive just across the road from Glazier's it was for lunch on Friday that a visit was made to Me Gusta Tacos, the clean and spacious build-out from a prior occupant giving the place a somewhat sterile feel that is quickly remedied by friendly service.

Best described as fusion, the ownership previously involved with Rachel's Kitchen deciding to expand their fresh and healthy eating portfolio to Mexican food given an eastern twist, guests entering Me Gusta Tacos will immediately find themselves greeted by a pair of servers who offer to help first-timers navigate a menu divided into several sections with Tacos front and center, seven types of Meat plus a Vegetarian option made daily on site in addition to three styles of Salsa made ""at least twice a day"" depending on demand.

Joining the quick-casual movement that many diners seem to enjoy white keeping lights bright and offering both an ""I love Tacos"" mirror as well as wall signage for Instagrammers, it is after payment that patrons are given a number and offered the choice of high-tops or standard seating, a spot at the window overlooking the parking lot selected with food arriving in less than five minutes, a housemade Agua Fresca proving very clean and herbal without a lot of unnecessary sweetness. 

Changing up beverages daily, though the best-selling Pineapple-Basil is apparently a mainstay, it was as baskets were delivered that squeeze bottles of Salsa were additionally offered, the flavors bold and descriptions of spice level entirely accurate despite the fact that labels were accidentally switched around with both the Roja and Verde compelling enough to warrant eating two accompanying orders of crispy Tortilla Chips.

Starting off three Tacos, a $9.50 value with Chips as each Taco is individually sold for $3.50 otherwise, it was in an attempt to sample as widely as possible that the tasting got started with shredded Pollo topped in Pico de Gallo, Cheddar and Avocado, the flavor of the Chicken unfortunately a little overwhelmed by the toppings though this certainly was not an issue for the spicy Barbacoa and tangy Kalbi with both cuts of Beef tender, moist and nicely accentuated by their condiments.

Equally intrigued by the Burritos as by the Tacos and Bowls, everything available in a healthy or Gluten-friendly version by way of simply removing the Tortilla, it was after some debate between Mission or California-style that the latter was selected, Queso Fresco subbed for Sour Cream making the housemade Tots stand out even more boldly in terms of texture while the slow-cooked pork was aromatic and succulent.

Rounding out the afternoon with one of three Churros, a version filled with Caramel selected over Bavarian Cream or traditional Cinnamon and Sugar for no particular reason, suffice it to say that those who've experienced Churros in Mexico City or Barcelona will likely be unimpressed by the texture as oil penetrates deep, thus making everything a bit too heavy, though the flavor itself is as sweet and decadent as the ingredients would make one suspect.

****Not claiming to be ""authentic"" in any way, the focus instead on quality ingredients and preparations that can be adjusted to fit most dietary restrictions, Me Gusta Tacos offers another locally owned and healthy option for those seeking an affordable lunch or dinner option in the rapidly developing Southwest."

This particular review is going to be on the Carne Me Gusta Bowl and pineapple basil drink I personally had. I really recommend this since it is a very healthy alternative to an actual burrito without getting the carb guilt. The bowl came with soft quinoa, crunchy cabbage, tender steak and tangy mango dressing. I added my two favorite salsa's the green and habanero for the extra spice and enjoyed every bit of this dish. When the spice would get high I would took a sip of the pineapple basil agua fresca and cooled off with this cold refreshment.  The bowl has definitely become one of my new favorites aside from the tacos of course. To top off my meal I ordered a Bavarian cream churro which was warm and fresh. I will definitely be back again next time I am in town."

The food is fresh and healthy yet flavorful with their amazing salsas that are made in house daily, twice a day. I went through almost an entire bottle of salsa verde with my meal. Yes, it was that good. I even ate other people's chips just so I had an excuse to eat more salsa

Love that they offer fish tacos with grilled fish! Interesting flavor with the wasabi cream sauce. Honestly, I didn't think I would like it as I'm usually not a fan of wasabi but I was pleasantly surprised it wasn't too overpowering. Also, the salsa verde made on anything makes it perfect! 

For the shrimp burrito, they were generous with the amount of shrimp in it and it was all really fresh with sizeable chunks of shrimp spread evenly throughout the two halves.

I'll definitely be back soon :) wish they sold the salsa verde in jars!"

I'm always skeptical when a restaurant has 5 stars with over 50 reviews, but I came to Garden Grill with an open mind.  And man, this place is very good.  Plant-based ingredients, terrific dishes, and surprisingly large portions.  The meal had a hangover cure feel to it as the sandwiches were full of heavy ingredients and sauce and bread, but still terrific.  The California Burrito ($12) was the size of a large Chipotle, full of beans, pico de gallo, guacamole, plant-based steak, cheese, and french fries.  I could have done without the french fries and cheese but the rest of the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  The hot sauce was awesome as well; don't forget to get extra.  The buffalo chicken sandwich ($10) had  a little too much sauce, but the meat itself was so flavorful that I'll give the sauce overload a pass. Add the great coleslaw on the sandwich and we have a winner. 

The prices are of a sit down brunch spot overall but the portions are big and service was great and quick. The bread greatly underperformed in my opinion on the sandwich as well as the tortilla for the burrito, which is the main reason I'm knocking Garden Grill down from a 5 star experience.  I do really like that they park specifically at Farmer's Market which show the spot's freshness.  I would come here often if they opened a storefront.  Here's to hoping."

For the price you are paying and the portion you are getting, you should definitely be paying more! The banh mis are HUGE. You could eat half and save the other half for later (which is what I did, heh). I got the chicken banh mi and my boyfriend the kogi beef (?). We also got the Thai tea with boba and taro tea w boba.

The Vietnamese ham sandwich was loaded and I mean stuffed.  The bread was plentiful with a light crunch with every bite. The pickled daikon and carrots were delish.  The gio lua, cucumbers, and jalapenos were sliced thicker then other places and the cilantro was very fresh.  

The smoked brisket flavor was on point and my kids really enjoyed it.

This popped up on Yelp with 5 stars and beautiful looking boba drinks so I bookmarked it. 

Looking thru more pictures, I saw sandwiches and thought.. that's weird.. a Vietnamese place that serves American styled sandwiches (although they have banh mi too). I put off trying the place cuz I couldn't trust that these sandwiches would be worth my time. But I was so wrong! In the past month, I must've eaten here like 7 times. 

The Pastrami Panini is my favorite hands down! Brisket Banh Mi is really good. Philly Cheesesteak Grilled Cheese is really good too but the bread wasn't the best. We've tried other sandwiches too and they were all delicious! $7-9 for a sandwich sounds a bit expensive but I've always had to save half for next meal so it's worth it! 

The drinks.. we are addicted to the Vietnamese coffee! We've tried the fruity and milk teas, not bad overall. The price is a little high though I'd admit. 

What else.. front counter lady is very nice, remembers my face cuz I come here too much haha.

At first glance the cafe doesn't look like it belongs with a bar next door and small businesses surrounding it in the complex.  The outside is nicely decorated with window wraps showcasing some items from the menu along with its bright green background so you don't miss its location.  My first trip to Bosa Boba Cafe I decided to try the Bahn Mi with pork bologna and the milk tea with Boba.  The sandwich was packed with meat and garnishes between the soft and delicious bread.  I would say the contents of the bahn mi doubled any other place I've been to in town and the price is very reasonable.  The milk tea was just the right amount of sweetness and the Boba was cooked softer than most places I've been so expect soft and chewy.  My one concern was the slight aroma of sewage permeating the cafe which is overwhelming at first.  I definitely recommend checking out Bosa Boba Cafe for the sandwiches and drinks!

Rd because of the odd location. So to my surprise, my sister Marlene and I had a pleasant experience. I came across a few posts here and initially I didn't want to check it out. However, my sister (fellow Yelper too) convince me to try it out.  

Upon entering, we were greeted immediately and felt welcome, because the cashier\/host ask if it was our first time. She went over the Menu with us and explained the various option and popular items that she recommended to us. We end up ordering a Chicken Pesto Panini, Smoked Brisket Banh Mi, Parmesan Garlic Fries to share. For drinks, we got a Vietnamese Iced Coffee and Mangonada.

The presentation is simple but straightforward, However, everything was really good! Especially the bread, crispy and soft in texture. Paired well with the Chicken Pesto and Smoked Brisket. The special sauce in both sandwiches was flavorful with a balanced amount of spices. It was a Garlic-like taste but it didn't overpower the other ingredients in each sandwiches. The Parmesan Garlic Fries were amazing! Especially when paired with the Garlic dipping sauce that was suggested to  us. Drinks were delicious; the Vietnamese Iced Coffee was just right and the Mangonada had a delicious taste because it had a component of Passion Fruit, which gave it an Asian twist.

Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely recommend it to others. It was like having Vietnamese inspired food with modern infusion mixed with SoCal culture in a comforting way type of experience! 

FYI: The cashier\/host that assisted us, is the owner. Her name is Nancy and is originally from Orange County. We had a great conversation with her and learned about her inspiration to open her own restaraunt. Nancy is related to Vanessa, her Sister who is the owner of Pho Bosa.

The space is tucked into an end spot in a plaza on Polaris, but inside the decor is calming and the service is super sweet.

I came in when they first opened and got a brisket bahni mi that really didn't do anything for me- the portion was right for the price but the brisket itself was gristly and greasy. Veggies were fresh and spreads were flavorful but not enough to save the sando.

Returned recently to find they've made some changes in their exterior, menu, and hours. Opted for the OMG (turkey, bacon, avo spread, spinach, deli mustard, cheese), customized on Dutch crunch with arugula sprouts, and a green Thai tea from their Yelp check-in offer. Such a tasty lunch, with plenty left over for later! Their DC bread is sweet and crunchy without ripping up the roof of my mouth, and it's gigantic (see photos).  There's a lot going on with the ingredients but they harmonize well, and the tea wasn't too sweet.

My boyfriend had a bite of my leftovers, and for my mayo hating bf, I would recommend asking for ""light mayo.""

I went back today (the following Monday) during my lunch break on the first day of my new job. I got the brisket banh mi as well as the green Thai tea that I was offered a sample of on my last visit. Bomb! If you like Thai tea & matcha milk tea, I would recommend giving it a try. I hope they bring BBQ pork banh mi soon, and maybe start opening weekends? ^___^v"

I ordered the smoked brisket sandwich and a lavender boba milk tea. I think the smoked brisket was ok. They put way too much mayo in the sandwich. I got kinda bored eating the sandwich half way in because the bread got soggy and too much mayo that I couldn't really taste the meat. They do give alot of meat in the sandwich but it because not as flavorful as i thought. Overall it was ok for me but i do like the lavender milk tea though."

Oh i forgot to mention, they catered my wedding. (Yes i love sandwiches that much) I ordered the chicken grilled cheese and pastrami grilled cheese. They were a hit!

Everything is a must try here! I wanted to go down the list but I'm stuck in chicken banh mi right now !

The Hokkaido milk tea is very good, has a coconut taste to it. The Nagasaki is my favorite at the moment. I can't really explain that one. 

One more thing, the owner let me taste the green Thai tea.. YES, green...thai...tea... It's pretty bomb!

What an unexpected lunch find on a lovely Sunday afternoon! I was initially roaming around Spring Mountain looking for some Vietnamese food when I spotted the green window screen wrap of this store. Located on the first floor in a fairly non descript plaza next to a bar on Spring Mountain and Polaris, you will find the pictures of sandwiches and boba drinks on the window. There is plenty of parking available too. 

When I walked in. I was immediately greeted by a smiling lady who offered me a menu right away. The menu is straightforward, but offers a a little something for everyone. The choices includes classic Vietnamese sandwiches (bahn mi), American comfort grilled cheese sandwiches on Texas toast ( God bless America! ), and paninis. There is also Special-Teas, boba drinks, snow-which is like a slushie, and Vietnamese ice coffee. I ordered the Pork Bologna bahn mi, Smoked Brisket bahn mi, Philly Cheese sandwich, and a Lavender Milk Tea (which for a dollar more you can get the tea in a male or female shaped resealable plastic bottle). I thought the plastic bottles were different than the lightbulb bottles I've seen before in tea shops and it's Vegas appropriate. Plus, I can save my drink in transport too. I explained to the friendly lady that I was worried the Lavender tea would taste like potpourri, but she assured me hers was delicate and was one of her favorites. She even gave me a stamp card and a to go menu for the future.

I sat in the little waiting area where I placed my order, but I noticed there was a seating area off to the side if you wanted to dine in. I walked over to check it out and the place is really chic, well decorated, and very clean. I went back to the take out waiting area where a large family came in and she also greeted them right away and took their order! She was finishing my order and starting on the large family's one. Talk about efficient with customer service skills! My order was ready before I knew it. As I was leaving with the bag of goodies, which smelled hot and amazing, she said goodbye with a smile. 

The Smoked Brisket was flavorful and had a good complex flavor of sweet and smokey. The pickled carrots and daikon added a bright vinegar note too. Be careful if you don't like spicy though because the bahn mi traditionally has jalapeno slices which I forgot were in there. It added heat, but I will ask for no jalapenos next time. The Pork Bologna was just as delicious, but not as rich as the brisket. Good if you want a lighter bahn mi for lunch, but both was filled to the brim with meat and veggies. The Philly Cheese sandwich was on sliced marble rye, which I didn't expect, but was tasty too. Meat was tender and well seasoned. Not salty and there was a good amount of cheesy goodness to round out all the meat. Then the Lavender milk tea...so good! The floral note was subtle and the sweetness level was just enough to enhance the tea itself. Definitely one of my new favorite milk tea now.

So what did I learn today? Don't be judgy of a place on the outside, give new places a try, and keep an open appetite. This place was a delicious food find and the service from the only person working there (from what I can tell) is a prime example that you can have amazing food and service at the same time. The prices are very reasonable and the quality of the food I've tried says that she takes pride in her work. Will be coming back for sure and highly recommend."

My friend brought me here, because he knew the owner, Nancy. She's super nice and mans the front.

The fish looked pretty fresh and not that stingy with it. The only downfall is that we noticed that they didn't give us some of the toppings we requested on the check list.

Pros:
Good fish portion.  They weigh it out so its consistent every time.  I thought they were pretty generous with the amount of fresh fish

Friendly staff and clean restaurant.  The staff is really nice and the space is very clean and new.  Its a good environment

Flavors were pretty good.  I chose the salmon bowl (normal size) and thought all the ingredients went really well together.  It was toped with salon, seaweed salad, tamago, crab meat, spicy tuna, crunchy wontons and cucumbers.    I opted for salad instead of rice and they didn't have a problem with that.

All bowls and burritos comes with complimentary sweet potato chips and they give you a free soda with a yelp check in!

Cons:  
To be fair, the reason why I gave it 4 stars is just how the poke restaurant is structured.  I think I prefer a poke bar where you can add as many ingredients as you want.  This place the bowls are all structured with set ingredients.  Options are a little limited.  You also don't get too many options with sauces.  

Some of the fish pieces were a little chewy.  But overall it was delicious."

Stopped by recently and I'm super glad I did. The food is great and the quality is fantastic! The interior is also very clean and chic with a variety of stuff on the menu.

I got the Sashimi Poke Bowl for about $12 full size and the portions are generous. Couldn't even finish it so I might just get the smaller bowl for like $9 next time instead. The bottom is split into half mixed greens salad and half rice. It was well seasoned and topped with a TON of Poke and seaweed salad. The flavor was very good and the fish tasted fresh with a nice texture.

They were also running an offer of a side of free sweet potato fries\/miso soup depending on what you get. The soup was decent but I wasn't much for the fries. They also have mochi ice cream available!


Overall, I would definitely recommend and I'll be back! (:"

I had sashimi bowl which had combination of 6 to 7 different kind of sashimi with rice and mixed green.  Food was awesome and loved the freshness of the ingredients.  it also came out with miso soup and sweet potato chips.  Miso soup was AMAZING!

I got the sea world sushi burrito, which was delicious and had a good amount of fish in it.

Overall, it you're like me and you're curious about sushi burrito trend, this is a great place to try it out for a reasonable price."

Giving 4 stars for the food.  I was turned off by one of the staff members when I stopped inside the store.  I believe her name is Talice.  She wasn't wearing her name tag so I had to ask another girl that was working for her name.  She didn't seem happy to be there and was not very pleasant either.  She seemed irritated and did not have any customer service skills.  I asked what the popular item was as it was my first experience and she seemed irritated from my question.  Not really someone I want to deal with again.  Must have been an off day as previous reviews says that the staff is awesome.  The girl that prepared my pizza was ok.  Her name was CJ.  I'd still come back as the food was good but as long as I don't have to deal with that cranky employee again.  She was definitely a HUGE turn off!

I have been going to the Food Truck Party near Total Wine on Centennial Center and when I noticed on social media that this truck would be there I had to stop by. They had a long line and you need to be prepared to wait 5-10 minutes after ordering because each corndog is hand-dipped to order and fried to perfection. The corndogs come in a couple sizes and range in price from $4-$6. Not every time, but sometimes the truck does have fried cheese sticks and you'll want to try these if they have them when you visit. The fried cheese sticks have the same delicious crispy batter as the regular corndogs, but are filled with either pepper jack or american cheeses. The corndogs themselves are really tasty. I always order mine with honey and suggest you do also. The honey is drizzled on after the corndog comes out of the fryer. I also add ketchup and mustard that's usually in coolers right outside the truck and you can add as much as you want. The people working the truck are very friendly.

These are the best corn dogs I've ever had. The breading was lite and crispy. The dog itself is juicy and flavorful. What I also like it that the corn dog batter does not over power the taste of the dog itself. It all goes together so well.

I would have never thought to put honey on a corn dog; What Have I Been Missing!?

The menu is simple so, there's not much to think about besides the size of your dog and how good it's going to taste.

Karved is a new fast-casual restaurant focused on rotisserie meats and, thus far, a simple menu with sandwiches, plates, sides, and some other items. They're sandwiched (appropriately) between TIABI and Sakana in a fairly small strip mall on Maryland Parkway. 

My eyes lit up when I first saw porchetta on the menu photo. It's not a common if at all available pork preparation in this town (or at least as far as Yelp reviews have cataloged it). After I checked with a friend and received confirmation that it's awesome, I beelined there for lunch, finding the place fortunately (for me) not very busy.

After seeing the rotisserie at work right behind the counter, with Brussels sprouts and roasted potatoes both filling drip trays below the porchetta, I decided that I should go pick one of those as a side. Fearing a potential food coma, I kept it light by picking the Brussels sprouts ($4), which appropriately came out at the same time as the sandwich. I wouldn't outright call them mushy, but they're on the soft side and had no crunch. Also, the portion on this was a bit modest for the price. At least the Brussels sprouts are subtly tasty, likely owing to the porchetta drippings.

The owner was offering sample cups of Cilantro Chicken Soup ($5) while people waited for their orders. After tasting it, I almost had to order one to-go. It's balanced in seasoning and thickness, and the chicken was so tender that you don't even have to hear the owner say that the soup is made fresh daily. Plus, the bowl is quite generously sized.

I did bury the lede a bit, and that's the brilliant Porchetta Sandwich ($12). I was worried that the ""French baguette"" bread would be tough if not outright sharp, but it was simply a delicious and chewy container for the goodness within. That treasure starts with awesome porchetta, including juicy pork loin and the crispy skin of the belly, the latter an unparalleled textural experience. The lemon sauce (with herbs) complements everything perfectly, and the fresh arugula completes the Italian-inspired experience. It doesn't get too messy compared to some sandwiches.

The porchetta alone earns Karved a top rating in my book, and the chicken soup was memorable enough for me to overlook the Brussels sprouts. Hopefully, I'll be free to come back soon to try some of their other options, including that yet-to-be-explored tri-tip."

The amber cracklings added some snap to the generous sandwich, topped with peppery arugula tossed in seasoned olive oil. Listen up pork afficionados, Hawaiians and Filipino compatriots--if you love porchetta, lechon and roast pig, you will love this sandwich!  If your dream sandwich includes beef instead, prepare to be happy with their tender tri-tip. My hubby was made very happy with his choice. Let it be noted that he had to take home the remaining half of his sandwich because #1, we were given samples of their delicious spicy beef broth soup and chicken cilantro rice soup; and #2, we gorged ourselves on their hummazing hummus and hot fried pita triangles, in addition to herb seasoned french fries plus fry sauce (yay, a noteworthy resemblance to yummy Utah Greek diner fry sauces).

The owner, I believe (Minnesota man who also loves hockey) let us try their frozen, fresh yogurt made today by his wife.  Creamy, tangy and lemony flavored goodness, topped with crushed honey-soaked baklava.  WOW, I would stop in here just for that!  Who am I kidding?

The location is cute and clean, the service is engaging and informative, and the food is tasty and fresh!

They're marketed as a rotisserie, and their chicken plates are a highlight, but I have so far stuck to their sandwiches.  The porchetta is amazing, hearty and juicy with a nice crispy skin for contrast, piled on a hearty artisan roll with arugula, parsley gremolata, and a lemon sauce. It was a fantastic lunch, and I didn't eat for the rest of the day because I was so full.

The tri-tip sandwich was also tasty, with a heap of caramelized onions and a really great garlic sauce for kick. This paired well with their fries, and again, it was a humongous portion. They have seasonal soups; I preferred the beef over the chicken. Their warm and chewy pita chips are my favorite version I've come across; the $4 portion with creamy hummus is huge enough to be a meal in itself.

Both visits have treated me to lots of staff interaction, from answering my annoying questions about the food to trying samples of other dishes and getting detailed info about their menu and concept. Everyone here is very friendly and everything is made fresh in house, from the sauces to the breads and everything in between. Looking forward to coming back for their chicken pita next time!

EDIT: Returned for the chicken pita! It was bomb, and so healthy too. The green goddess dressing is delicious, they really do have amazing sauces here. Sided my order with the the Brussels sprouts, which are nearly the size of golf balls, and lightly roasted and seasoned. Perfection again!"

Pastrami, corned beef, brisket, pulled pork,  a burger, italian salumi and porchetta.  Veg?  Sigh, if you must but make sure it's grilled and hammered to death or wilting from the meat fat.

Karved makes one heck of a great sandwich.  Porchetta.  Take a lean pork tenderloin.  Roll it inside a pork belly, it's skin on the outside.  Season heavily.  Rotisserie roast until golden brown, cracklin on the outside,  juicy, and fatty in all the right ways on the inside.  Slice that bad boy up.  Shove it in a fresh baked, chewy, crispy baguette, wilt up some greens, add a generous slathering of herbaceous, lemony, garlicky gremolata.  Heaven.  The crispy pork cracklin adds great texture while the sweetness of the pork is brought out by the bright gremolata.  An outstanding sandwich.  A solid value at $12.

Also available, a rotisserie chicken and tri-tip.  Ordered as a plate, the chicken is as good as any.  The tri-tip, well seasoned, cooked medium, tender, juicy, it's flavor brought to life by the spice heat of an aji verde (Peruvian green chili sauce).  OK roasted Brussels sprouts that could use more char for complexity.  All good, this place is all about the porchetta.

Friendly local service.

While I wouldn't say it's so epic and iconic, ie drive from Centennial great, if you're in the area, a very worthy treat."

In an already tight parking lot, there will soon be less parking once the majority of Vegas learns about this delicious joint.

Quite possibly the star of the menu is their Porchetta sandwich.  One of the staff (possibly the owner?) walked me through the steps it took to create this flavorful masterpiece.  Totaling a three to four hour process, pork tenderloin is first rolled inside pork belly, then cooked rotisserie-style, and sliced up into juicy, tender pieces.  These are tossed into a fresh, chewy baguette slathered with a lemon caper gremolata spread and some greens.   If that isn't enough, pork cracklins are tossed over the sandwich to add a nice crunch to the mix.  It's just a burst full of flavor and truly makes this one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life.

My wife and I also enjoyed the combo Peruvian Chicken and Beef tri-tip combo platter with potatoes, rice, and brussel sprouts on the side.  Three sauces were all sampled and three sauces were well-liked.   Hot, aji verde, and garlic all accentuated the flavors of the meat.   The portions were generous enough to eat for lunch and have saved some left over for dinner.

A few people just gave up and got cup of noodles from a vending machine instead. 

I really like chicken and waffles in general but their chicken and waffles are just okay. The butter is on the waffles so they got soggy pretty quick. The chicken was tender. It's definitely not worth waiting for 15-20 minutes plus to get the food.

So we went to Tenaya Creek Brewery last night to celebrate a friend's bday. We noticed that they have different food trucks on occasion but don't have a kitchen on site. We did the prep work by researching what food truck we would get to try  while we were there and saw it was Mama Napoli. 

OMG. so good. First of all, they have a wood fire oven on the truck - I just knew it would be legit. Ingredients are fresh and prices are about 11-15 for a pizza with about 8 slices? The girl that delivered the pizza to us at the bar had the biggest and warmest most sincere smile on her face. I was so excited to try it. And It was so delicious. Like beyond. The  flavors and the cheese and crust oh my god. I can honestly say this was the best pizza I have had in Vegas. My picture does not do it justice because everyone wanted to put their hands all over and grab a slice before it was gone- not realizing my Yelp photography always comes first!!

Anyway, Tenaya Creek has an awesome vibe but even better that you can order the most delicious pizza ever to accompany your beer and chill at the bar."

Came up to Las Vegas for the weekend with the wife, and stayed at The Cannery.  We were looking for a good local joint not to far by and feeling burgers found this place on Yelp.

The joint is located in a 'err, umm, ahhhh', lets just say sort of questionable part of town.  It wasn't scary, but it what used to be a house in an older part of town, and thank god for Waze or we never would have found it as we had to drive through back streets in the residential part of the block to get there as there was no easy access from the direction we were traveling in on the far side of the main road.

So we got there probably 2 minutes after the place opened, and just walking in is an experience.  The owner has a friend who is an artist, and there are all these funky paintings of classic singers and actors from the 30's up.  It's got a real Soul Food feel to it, and wouldn't be out of place at all in a Quentin Tarantino film.  The vibe was totally funky!

The owner has got to be one of the nicest guys I've ever met.  Despite doing all of his prep work to open for the day he constantly checked up on us, and then when one of his employees showed up that guy did the same thing.  Then the food showed up.  The fries were home made, and daayuuum were they delic!!!  The burgers were awesome as well, and I have to say that it was one of the best meals I had in Vegas!  

We will definitely go back, and I recommend this place whole heartedly!  My apologies to the owner for not writing this review sooner, it was about 8 months ago that we were there, but you know how life gets in the way sometimes."

There's so many items here I don't even know the direct English translations for so I'll just describe them as best I can. Hon Pocha focuses on featuring food that's lesser known such as the aggujjim, dakbal and meatjun. 

This is one of the few places that sells aggujjim if you're into that. What the hell is that you say?? It's 'braised spicy angler', according to Google but I'd describe it as spicy monkfish. If you've never had monkfish before the texture is similar to catfish. Be careful because it's commonly served with the bones intact but it's very easy to eat around it and dispose of it properly.

The dakbal is literally chicken feet and it's served in spicy seasoning sauce. I'm not a huge fan of dakbal because the meat is pretty scarce. However it is pretty good considering how flavorful the seasoning is. Not my first choice but not entirely bad either!

The meatjun, which is similar to Korean pancake (pajun), is delicious. It's a safe bet if the other two dishes sound a little too crazy for you. It has a thin layer of batter on the outside and tasty meat in the inside. Can't recall what type of meat but I want to say beef.

They didn't have their liquor license when I went there but the owner did mention they will carry all popular Korean alcohol such as soju, makgoeli (rice-based) and bokbunja (berry-based wine).

The interior is dark and dimmly lit, which is perfect for some late-night drinking and fun. It certainly has that vibe to be a go-to hang out spot for me, once they serve alcohol and finish up the decorating. It felt a little empty in there.

Will definitely return around December for a follow-up meal."

This is a hole in the wall that started out as a Thai place that went nowhere. I recently saw some signs of live here and good reviews of the place. Tried it out. The tamales plate was really good. Well seasoned tamales. Rice and refried bean complimented the entree nicely. Second time there I had the Chile Verde plate. It was a very large portion. Very tasty sauce for dipping the soft tortillas. The salsa for the chips tasted different and very good. My friend had the carne asada. He liked it both times we were there. Reasonable prices. Less than 23 bucks for two plates plus drinks. I think we are moving from Los Lupes.

In order (best to worse) my favorites were there the mochi ice cream, then the mango pudding, and then the cream puff.

The food for the most part was above average, but why this place really gets 5 stars is because of it's service. We admittedly had an obnoxious group of 6, but the wait staff was beyond friendly, patient, and accommodating. The main server was also training and I believe the resteraunt's service will be in good hands going forward."

Highly recommend this place.

Update: 

I had the Dungeoness Crab Meat with Egg White.... OUT OF THIS WORLD!! Absolutely perfect! The egg white omelette stir fried with fresh crab meat is so flavorful, great to eat with some rice. The dish was the favorite of the entire table!

Note: This was not on the menu, but recommended by the chef. Needless to say this was a first, but we were not disappointed. The sashimi was followed with what was left of the lobster including deep fried head, leg and tail. Yumm!! Our main dishes consisted of wok-seared tenderloin beef, which was insanely tender and flavorful and abalone and chicken served in a clay pot. As we were there celebrating a birthday, they surprised us with traditional Chinese longevity peaches, basically a lotus flavored bun filled with a sweet surprise. This place was on the expensive side of things, but that is to be expected and very well worth it. This was an experience I will never forget and definitely recommend to others!"

SERVICE: I got lucky this afternoon around lunch time and was able to pull right in and get my car detailed and on a Friday too! Francisco and his crew of 3 was able to hand wash and wax my car in about 25 minutes! The team was very professional and did a fantastic job bringing the shine out on my black car. My car didn't really need much attention on the interior since I keep my car very clean any ways but the exterior needed a nice coat of wax. Make sure you do a good walk around of your vehicle before you leave in case they've missed a spot or two. I found a few spots they missed and they fixed it immediately. Don't go home and complain and write a bad review when you could have had them correct it right there on the spot.

Before the wedding:
Bride squad picked up in Hummer stretch limo and dropped off at our chapel. Groom Squad picked up and dropped off.

We opted not to use their refreshments package due to we already were content from our bridal suite luncheon and our groom's poker party luncheon. Our wedding wasn't until 7:30pm and we didn't want our wedding party wasted before the I Do's. 

Post-wedding: 
Shuttles for EVERYONE to return to the hotels (strip and off-strip).

Our transportation was handled very well by Greg. We even got a last minute free upgrade due to a cancellation by another party. Due to the Labor Day holiday weekend Vegas All nite needed to use third-party vehicles for our post-wedding shuttles. 

Pros: Super Easy communication with Gregory. Great pricing. Nice vehicle options. 
Cons: The third-party shuttle that was assigned to me and my guy (Bride and Groom) had some irritating SNAFU'S. See my Bell Transportation review. 

Overall, Vegas All Nite provided awesome service in the planning stages and the wedding day. 

I was going to say if I got married again I would use Vegas All Nite, but HELLO! I'm only getting married one time. 

So, let me say this, if I am in Las Vegas for another cool event and we need sweet transportation, then Vegas All Nite it is! If I'm part of a bachelorette party and I help plan the event and it's in Vegas, then you know who I'm going to call. But, I'm older and all my friends and family are married so there goes that. 

So, if we're in Vegas and we want to turn up for...just because...Vegas All Nite!

Thanks again Greg for making everything so easy for us. It truly was a pleasure working with you."

In planning my epic birthday party in Vegas, I realized I need transportation for all my friends (19 people) from the restaurant to the Hard Rock, where we all had tickets to see Magic Mike Live. I'm budget conscious, but I also want everyone to have a good time, especially because not everyone knew one another. After reading reviews for VEGAS ALL NITE, I sent them a message on Yelp. Yelp also allowed me to send the same message request to other vendors, which would help me price match. Out of all of the vendors I contacted, VEGAS ALL NITE was not only quick, but personal in their response. One of the vendors just referred me to their website for info, and the others responded with a copied and pasted price. Gregory Miller, the owner of VEGAS ALL NITE, reached out to me in a personable way, and communicated with me quickly, answering all my questions. After receiving quotes from the vendors, his price was the best and most practical for my needs. I needed some time to decide, and the date I needed transportation was closing in quick. Gregory was extremely helpful in helping me make my decision for a 24 seat party bus (over the 22 seat stretch Hummer), and I'm so glad we went with it. It was easy to pay for the bus and include the tip over the phone, and I received documents via e-mail - invoice, contract, etc. The day of, I communicated with them and received a text from the driver so I could keep in touch as well. The PARTY BUS from VEGAS ALL NITE was one of my favorite parts of the weekend. The driver was friendly and helpful, and everyone had a great time. I highly recommend VEGAS ALL NITE and plan to book with them for my next outing in Sin City! Thanks so much, Gregory and staff!"

Quick to respond to any questions regarding service (I asked many). Diego F. was an outstanding chauffeur and host for our ""Thirty and Thirsty"" Crew. I surprised my friend for her birthday with a Escalade Mini Limo! She was throughly surprised and we had 2 bottles of cold champagne on our ride down the strip and to our hotel. The only negative thing I have to say is that unfortunately our flight was delayed 3 hours (Frontier\/awful horrible experience please don't fly with them) and when our airplane landed (wheels touch the ground) our time starts for the 1 hour we have to get to our hotel in the limo. There just so happen to be another airplane in our terminal so we were there sitting for 45 min before even the first person got off the airplane. When we got to Diego at the baggage claim he told us our hour was already up and we didn't even get to see the limo! It's unfortunate because I had planned my money accordingly in Vegas and wasn't ready for this set back, but I didn't want to disappoint my birthday girl so I told him to add another hour so we could at least make it to our hotel. Diego said he would ask if he could do it by the 1\/2 hour but was unable to. He definitely accommodated us as he could and had an Aux cord for us to play DJ which was cool. I just wish there was a better way for this company to accommodate us... maybe with delayed flights the customer could call when actually exiting the airplane? So things like this don't happen to another customer. We did do round trip, our ride back was nice. Our driver ""Rico"" was very nice, however he didn't have our bottle of champagne I had asked for set up. We had to ask about it, he didn't see it on our reservation... after he checked it he then gave us the bottle and glasses. I still highly recommend this company but I wanted to share my experience so future customers will have an even better experience if they so happen to have the few hiccups like we did."

Boqueria Street is a new food truck that, per their web site, just launched in January of this year. I'd be one of the first to say that you're usually not going to find anything truly special on wheels, with a few notable exceptions of course, so I'm not that I'd never heard of them until i saw the lineup of a new weekly food truck event that I was planning to visit. After trying the food, I became very surprised indeed.

The highlight of their menu of ""Barcelona Inspired Street Food"" (you'll see the words on both sides of the truck) is actually a separate blackboard full of Iberico ham options (Jamon Iberico ""de Bellota"" to boot, which is reputedly the highest qualtiy). The gentleman outside the truck pointed out this menu while I stared pensively at the truck, and the chef went so far as to offer me a sample.

I will admit that I have certainly never had Iberico before, so I have no point of comparison, but the morsel of meat that the chef offered me was the best thinly sliced ham that I have ever had the pleasure to taste - far richer than whatever prosciuttos that I've eaten (laugh at me all you want, but I'm not that well-traveled or experienced). Consequently, I had to order off their Iberico menu, whether or not the pig that this came from actually ingested acorns and only acorns all of its life.

I chose the Flat Bread of Iberico ($12), which was simply the ham draped on a flatbread, with some tomato and olive oil in between. I already waxed poetic about the ham, but the bread was surprisingly good, certainly far better than whatever run-of-the-mill pitas that every Greek place uses. The tomato was a welcome acidic accent, but perhaps slightly overpowering in some bites. Still, I'd definitely suggest ponying up for either this or really any of their other options if they offer what they call Iberico.

I was also hungry enough to order the Barcelona Sausage ($8.50), a non-encased pork sausage in a buttery roll with zucchini sprouts and chimichurri mojo verde. I really have to highlight the awesome roll, which is by far the best bread that I've had from a food truck and certainly one of the better ones if I include brick-and-mortar. They actually source it from local outfit Great Buns Bakery, but whether it's the third-party softness and airiness or the chef's grill treatment, you can't miss their bocatas (aka bocadillos, aka sandwiches) for this reason alone.

The sausage needed to shine too - heck, it's the namesake - and it indeed had a rich, meaty flavor. It kinda reminded me a bit of bratwurst, actually. The accompaniments are also nice, including some chips (taro?) that were somewhat prone to falling off but still delivered a touch of crunchiness. I'll likely also grab another bocata next time to see what else they have to offer.

By the way, both portion sizes are what I'd charmingly call ""modest."" But with food trucks, you're often prone to paying prices not too much lower for food that's certainly inferior. Same for brick-and-mortar places, sometimes. Go for quality over quantity here and then pig out on whatever gut bombs you might find at other trucks at events.

As food trucks often do, Boqueria Street posts their menu on their various social media pages, as well as their web site (which also has a copy of the menu, sin* Iberico). That's how you'll find them, and you definitely should make the effort to try one of the best food trucks in town and one of the more interesting new food ventures, four-wheeled and four-walled alike.

They are well worth hunting down, driving out of your way, and rearranging your schedule. The food lives up to the hype and then some!

Other standout menu items include the classic Jamon Serrano bocata with ham, mozzarella, and truffle mushrooms. The patatas bravas always make a great side with a zesty sauce and green onions, and are a generous portion for the $5 price tag. The croquetas are not always available, so get them if you see them- they're as tasty as the version served in a shoe on the Strip, at a fraction of the price.

Truly a menu with something for everyone. If you don't do pork products, there's the Pollo (chicken) bocata. There's a veggie roll that can be vegan-ized. Even pescatarians have the Gambas shrimp appetizer. And those are just the regular menu items! Each time I've found the BS truck, they have several featured special items, too. 

Though they may ""just"" be a food truck, the attention to detail and quality of product they put out is easily comparable to what is available at brick and mortar options.

The guys working are nice and seem to genuinely care about putting out quality food that tastes great. When you place your order don't expect to get handed food right away. They make everything to order and it can take time, but it's well worth it. 

Jamon Iberico ($13) - This is some tasty ham! The split-top rolls that they grill in butter really hold the fillings in nicely and tastes great. While I like this sandwich, I actually recommend the quesadilla which is stuffed with iberico ham, mushrooms and mozzarella. 

Patatas Bravas ($7) - This is a full portion, but you can add a smaller version for $3 to any meal. The menu describes this as fried potato wedges with Barcelona style spicy sauce. I like the patatas bravas a lot, but the flavor hasn't been consistent each time. Sometimes the sauce it much spicier than other times and even has a different color. 

Vaca Saltada ($11) - Braised beef, manchego cheese, red onion, spicy yellow chili mayo on a split-top roll grilled in butter and topped with pretty edible flowers. The beef has great flavor and all the fillings compliment each other well. This sandwich was well liked by all in my group that tried it. 

Croquetas ($7) - There's chicken inside these fried tasty gems. You get 4 of them in the order and side of Parmesan cheese bechamel for dipping. I feel like you should get at least 5 of them for the price given how small they are, but they do taste good. 

They also have chicken, sausage and veggie options. Check their social media pages to see where the truck will be next."

The Vaca Saltada is out of this world, the braised beef is so tender and juicy and its marinade is full of herbs and spices. Loaded with Manchego Cheese, Red Onion, Spicy Mustard and Chili Mayo. It's the perfect sandwich for this type of season, I should have bought a bunch to take it for a picnic.

If your looking for small bites the croquetas is a must have, They are deep fried into balls and stuffed with chicken, parmesan cheese and bechamel. After one bite I will never eat mozzarella sticks again, this tastes 1000x better so creamy and cheesy.

It's specializes in a small sampling of Barcelona Street food adapted to American taste.  Not 100% authentic, All good, just enjoy your food outdoors while you people watch.  You'll feel transported.

Credit where credit is due: thanks Stefany V for the recommendation.

Bocadillos, traditional Barcelona sandwiches, feature OUTSTANDING fresh bread with flavor, slightly chewy, toasted crisp that manages to hold everything in perfectly.  Amped up mayo and spreads and fresh veg and micro greens that actually make sense (the flavor of the micro greens adds to the enjoyment of the sandwich).  Proteins, very well chosen and blend well with everything.  The Jamon Serrano, sweet porky goodness and cured funk that pairs well with the mushrooms.  The Botifarra; naturally cased, coarse ground seasoned pork; delicious and fatty, intensified by a great chimichurri mojo verde.  Finally the vaca saltada; braised beef with manchego cheese and an earthy chili mayo, just plain good eats.

Do try an order of patas bravas (deep fried thick potato wedges with a spicy aioli).  Fluffy on the inside, gently crisp on the outside, it makes a perfect, rich side to any sandwich.

Note: If you have not tried Iberico ham from black footed, acorn fed pigs, AND it's on offer here, go for it.  It might not be as good as that sold by places on the Strip but at 1\/3 the price, unless you're a true gourmand, your tongue won't know the difference.

Prices are in line with the quality.  No foot long subs for $5 here.

If they only sold wine by the glass and that other famous Barcelona street food, churros.  Ahhhhh.

Be sure to check out their FB, IG, Twitter, and website to see where they are going to pop-up next.

An amazing food truck, well worth seeking out."

My buddy invited me to try this new italian restaurant Mamma Olivia in the BoulevardMall. 
The place is nice and cozy, with football game on.
The pit boss is an Italian himself, so he knows what hes talking about. 
He recomended the Ossobucco Veal, i asked him what was that, he nicely explain to me slow cooking Oxtail and love the way they cooks. 

This is probably the best italian resto in vegas.
Veal Ossobucco is my favorite from now on.
Their service is so different, its so italian. 

They have full bar in the middle with a bunch of widescreen TV.

So we chose to give Mamma Olivia's a shot. When we first walked up we were greeted by a very friendly hostess and the manager, Gina, who then informed us about the specials they were having as well as the happy hour that was running from 2-6. As I am a very avid happy hour junky that was music to my ears! Needless to say we grabbed a booth, which we were able to choose ourselves, and were promptly served a complimentary bruschetta. The kids were getting hungry so this helped keep the little gremlins at bay while we looked over the menus. We started with the fritto misto which was deep fried deliciousness! The shrimp, calamari, and broccolini were cooked perfectly and wasn't served with half of the grease coming out of the fryer onto the plate. We then ordered a caprese pizza for the kids excluding the basil and ordered osso bucco and lobster spaghetti for my wife and I. The presentation of all the plates shows how much the chefs preparing the food really care about it. It felt like every piece of food on the plate was purposefully placed and demonstrated a thoughtfulness on the very edge of art. A few bites into the food the manager Gina stopped by and first asked our kids if they were liking the pizza; who then answered enthusiastically that it was better than anything we (the parents) have ever cooked for them. After a good laugh we told her that the food was outstanding and full of flavor! The service from Josh was top notch and the atmosphere of the place says classy authentic Italian food. We will definitely be back to visit again with the whole family and can't wait to try new stuff from the menu! Thank you again for everything!"

Nachos ($10) - A huge pile a chips with beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, guacamole and your choice of meat, I picked steak. You can also choose red or green sauce, I went with green. I'm glad that my hubby was there to share the nachos with me because it's a lot! For $10 I was worried it was overpriced nachos, but seriously you get your monies worth. The chips tasted fresh and there was a fair amount of steak on the nachos. The beans were in need of some salt and while I saw green sauce, I couldn't taste it.

It is a time consuming process that requires the right cut of meat and the right blend of spices to create a truly outstanding jerky

This jerky has an outstanding flavor! You can smell the smoky aroma when you walk into the shop. When you eat the jerky you taste a smooth and smoky taste then the spices combine to create each flavor. The last thing your palate remembers is the savory afterglow.

If that wasn't outstanding enough (meat was beef and turkey) the pistachios were other worldly. I tasted three different flavors: Thai, salt and pepper, and habanero.

They were all incredible! I don't always like pepper but this wasn't over done and the salt added flavor as it should without becoming predominant. The habanero was definitely for those that love heat! I really liked the Thai. It was so yummy. I found myself sacking on a few shells as the nuts are soaked, cooked and rubbed with the flavor.

The service was so helpful. I really liked that you were given samples and the cooking process was throughly explained. If you don't try this place you are missing out!"

Let me preface this by saying I was a huge fan of the previous Mexican restaurant in this hard-to-find spot (El Frescos Cocina Mexicana). For whatever reason, they closed. The menu got tweaked, but prices stayed pretty much the same (read: high) and the new name is very similar. If you aren't looking closely, you might think it's the same business-  but the food isn't as good. 

The shrimp tacos I used to get here regularly were legendary. They were $6 but totally worth it. The new menu specifically calls the new shrimp tacos the ""house favorite""-- new tacos are a buck less but they don't even compare. The grilled shrimp wasn't seasoned, the mango salsa lacked discernible citrus notes, and the chipotle cream tasted like it was cut with mustard. It's a totally different taco, and I'm bummed about it. 

I also tried their carne asada el cachi taco, made with rib eye, and it was okay but the soggy singly-ply corn tortilla tore like half a bite in. How do so many reviews use the word ""authentic"" when they use ONE corn tortilla per taco?! It's gotta be double-thick, y'all. Taco Science 101.  

My server was friendly, asked for feedback and seemed genuinely interested in how they can improve, which is awesome. I really want to rave about this place but right now their tacos are just A-OK. Is it fair to judge a new business against the standard set by their predecessors? Well, when you offer the exact same cuisine, you're inviting the comparisons. Please make the shrimp tacos great again!"

The location was a little hard to find and that is the only negative thing I would say. For starters we ordered chips, salsa and guacamole. The chef made the guacamole to order (never had that done before) and the chips came out very fresh. We both ordered a couple tacos, because who could go wrong with taco, and neither of us has ever had a taco so flavorful and well executed.

To be very honest why I would give this place 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the location. The location is super confusing to follow because the first sign you see will have an arrow pointing to take a left turn, BUT in small print it says ""in 500 ft"" so naturally people will see a sign for El Cachi and turn the corner. It'll take you to a very SUSPICIOUS area and you'll think to yourself al I in the right place. Yes you are, but just get back and turn at the second sign which isn't as big but it's the right one. You'll feel like you're in an apartment complex and you will only know you're in the right place when you see a sign that says El Cachi.

The food was AMAZING!! I love the fact that this place is a Mom-and-Pops-kinda feeling with no fancy decor; just tables, chairs and some TVs.

I stumbled in here after one of our agents at our office told us about their soft opening after he had gotten them their lease for the building. Let's discuss the food shall we?

The Baja Fish Taco - by far my favorite! The fish is battered and fried to perfection! Upon subsequent trips here, I definitely expect to be ordering more of these in the future. The Carnitas, The Chicken Pastor, and the Grilled Skirt Steak Taco among some of the others that I also tried, great tacos!

There is also a number of drinks to try; we opted for the Jalopeno Lime Margarita, and the Passion Fruit Margarita. Both great choices! Although I might warn that the Jalopeno Margarita is a little on the spicy side. There are also a number of craft beers on tap to choose from. I decided to go with a pale ale from San Diego.

I also noticed that as the night grew a little older, more people started to come in to check the place out and gave the place a really nice vibe. I anticipate that this will definitely be a successful business!"

I saw the magical word ""Churro"" and decided that I just had to stop in. From the jump we were welcomed with warmness which is rather rare here in Vegas.

I ordered my churros and ice cream and when the super friendly girl behind the counter (I didn't catch her name) told me about their $2.00 draft special I knew it was something my husband would appreciate. 

My husband ordered his beer and had a potato and chorizo taco.

Now what caught my eye were two things: they have Tecate AND they have a salsa sampler. I'm from SoCal and can appreciate an ice cold Tecate and as a Latina i definitely appreciate my salsa.

The taco was great, the churros were yummy and the ice cream was a nice touch. 

Good tacos are hard to find here so my husband and I are excited to try everything on the menu. 

Did I mention the freshly made tortillas??? Yup, FRESH and so so good.

We will be back and after I pop out this little girl (yup I'm pregnant) I will definitely partake in the Micheladas, Margaritas and their beer specials.

Makai Pacific Island Grill serves Hawaiian food that's big on taste, big on portions, and small on price.  Ordering your food is simple...choose your size (small, medium, or large), your meats (chicken, pork, steak, or Ahi tuna), your base (white or brown rice), and finally your sides (edamame, veggies, corn, mac salad, or kimchee slaw).  I usually order the Ono'est, which is their large.  The large comes with 3 choices of meat and everything is weighed to the ounce.  The chicken Katsu serving is 4 ounces, Teri chicken is 4.5 ounces, and steak serving is 3.5 ounces. That's 12 ounces of meat for only $9.99.  Dem Gainz at a cheap price!!

The place was large with over 20 tables and booths, it had 14 large screen TV's playing different sporting events and Mexican Music Videos on the screens.  I could see a waitress in the back and I grabbed a menu and chose a table near the front entrance.  The waitress approached me immediately and said something to me and I said that I couldn't hear her and she couldn't hear me answer and finally it dawned on her that the music was too loud and she grabbed a remote and turned the music coming from one of the TV's down.  I'm glad she did because I wouldn't have stayed if it continued to be that loud.  I ordered 2 shredded beef enchiladas with extra refried beans and rice with shredded lettuce on a separate plate, and settled on ice water to drink.  I was given a small dish of chips and salsa and  although it salsa was ok, it could have been more flavorful and I added the standard Mexican condiments to the salsa to give it more flavor. My order came out on a heated  plate and my beans and rice on a separate plate as ordered.  The shredded beef enchiladas were covered in red sauce and cheese and were good but I wished I had ordered them with some onion.  The beans and rice were better than what most places serve and I would order the dish again.  My bill came to $7.58 and I thought it was very reasonable.

We called the other company we bought from to complain and the owner, was not having it and said John was wrong. I told him how was John wrong when he fixed the issue. Then the started blaming the sales rep that he must have given us the wrong unit. I asked for a discount from that company, but he refused of course. I now know who I will be calling when any of my grills goes out and I have three.   Thank you John for making me not hate my Evo grill."

My boyfriend and I are suffering from serious withdrawals because the food we had surpassed our expectations. We ate:
-A chocolate cookie and brownie from Purple Potato (yes, we had dessert first!). They were not too hard or too soft, just delightfully chewy and tasty. Also, the price was reasonable ($2 each).
-A buffalo chick'n sandwich from Garden Grill. Although the sandwich was $11, it was a nice medium size. The patty was still crispy despite being dipped in tangy, slightly spicy buffalo sauce, which my boyfriend and I devoured instantly.
-A macaroni and cheese bowl with corn and bbq chick'n as the toppings from Southern Fried Vegan. This was my boyfriend's favorite and my second favorite treat. It was also the priciest food item we purchased ($15), but it was definitely worth it. 
-A large lemonade from Pancho's Kitchen. My boyfriend says it's the best lemonade he has ever had because it wasn't bitter, slightly sour, and the sweetness was just right.
-3 for $5 falafel balls from Panevino Italian Grille. Now these were my favorite! All falafels should taste like Panevino's. They had a slight crunch on the outside and hot, soft goodness in the inside. A decadent tomato sauce was drizzled on top. I wish we had ordered more than three..
-A potato masala bowl from Desi Burrito, which contained the potato masala, rice, lettuce, pico de gallo, and a special sauce that I did not get the name of, but it improved the taste of the already delicious bowl. Only $6! My boyfriend and I got lucky because we had the last of the potato masala!
-A slice of pumpkin cheesecake from Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan (yes, we had dessert again..). It came with a small container of strawberry sauce that we drizzled on top. I wish it was bigger because it was $7 for a slice about the size of my palm. Also, it did not really taste pumpkin-y; it tasted like a regular cheesecake, but still incredibly tasty with a perfect texture! 

Thank you for the free parking and free admission! We are super excited to attend next year's Vegas Veg Fest!"

I have been anxiously awaiting this place to open and somehow I missed out their opening last week! No worries because I got to visit this morning and I'm super happy with what I experienced.

Living down the road just South of here...it's slim pickin' on fresh, healthy eats...which I find super odd because hello?!?!? it's the Medical District! Look no further King's Cafe to the rescue! 

Welcomed with a smile and hello, this modern clean new cafe offers free WifI with breakfast and lunch style options. Seating is for 58 so bring plenty friends and coworkers. 

I chose the Vegan Sandwich which I opted for a tomato wrap. They have a choice of whole grain rolls, pita, sliced bread and tortillas in tomato, spinach, or regular. I don't like bread (yes I'm weird) but I can def get down on a tortilla.
The wrap was very large, fresh and bursting with flavor. I am glad that they suggested the Fig Glaze because I'm truly in love with it. I also asked for some hummus to be inside of it and very glad I did. The Fig Glaze and hummus made it creamy and savory and accompanied the crispy fresh veggies perfectly. 

As they were building my dream wrap, I noticed that even though this cafe is new...it is SUPER clean and organized. The large open kitchen was thoughtfully planned, everything has it's place. No clutter in sight. Something like this makes me at ease the food I am purchasing to fuel my body comes from a great business. This seems like a family run cafe from the few minutes I was there and the sense of pride was truly apparent. 

I asked about the soups and unfortunately the Picante (vegan) one was still being prepared, but I did show up at like 9 am so that's totally understandable! I will be back!

I'm not a fan of smoothies but after a few questions...I was anxiously to try one.
I chose the mixed berry but they did offer a mango or a strawberry banana also. I got to choose between apple juice or orange juice as my base. I chose orange juice. Then they offered soy or almond mylk to add. Heck yes! I opted for almond mylk.
To some it up it seriously taste like an Orange Julius from my childhood. It took me a few hours to place my finger on what it reminded me of but yep...it does! It's tartness is not sour nor is this smoothie sweet. Exactly how I like a smoothie and I'm glad I made the choice selections.

Always a good experience. Friendly staff and the subs are always fresh and tasty. I especially enjoy their large tuna. I go early as lunchtime can be very busy.
